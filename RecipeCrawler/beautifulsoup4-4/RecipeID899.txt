Ingredients
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
3/4 cup Kikkoman Roasted Garlic & Herbs, Toasted Sesame,
Honey & Mustard or Gourmet Teriyaki Quick & Easy Marinade
6 (10-inch) metal or bamboo skewers*
Directions
Cut chicken into 2-inch square pieces. Place in large plastic food storage bag; pour in quick & easy marinade. Press air out of bag; close top securely. Turn bag over several times to coat all pieces well. Marinate 20 minutes, turning bag over once.
Thread each skewer with chicken, leaving space between pieces.
Grill or broil 4 to 5 inches away from heat source 7 minutes.
Turn skewers over; brush with additional quick & easy marinade. Cook 5 minutes longer, or until chicken is no longer pink in center.
*Soak bamboo skewers in water 30 minutes to prevent burning.
