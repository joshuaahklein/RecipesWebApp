Ingredients
8 chicken thighs (about 1-3/4 lbs.)
1/2 cup Kikkoman Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon grated fresh orange peel
Directions
Remove bone from each thigh, being careful to keep skin attached to meat. Cut each thigh lengthwise in half; place halves in large plastic bag.
Combine teriyaki sauce, onion powder, honey and orange peel; pour into bag over chicken. Press air out of bag; close top securely. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight, turning bag over occasionally.
Thread 4 halves on each of 4 wooden or metal skewers.
Place skewers on grill 4 to 5 inches from hot coals. Cook about 8 to 10 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink in in center; turn over occasionally. (Or, place skewers on rack of broiler pan. Broil 5 to 6 inches from heat source 8 minutes on each side, or until chicken is no longer pink in center.)
