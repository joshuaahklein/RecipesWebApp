1/2 cup sour cream or plain yogurt
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup finely chopped cooked chicken
1 package (11 oz) Old El Paso flour tortillas for burritos (8 tortillas; 8 inch)
1/4 cup guacamole
1/2 cup Old El Paso refried beans (from 16-oz can)
1 cup shredded Cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese (4 oz)
Directions
Heat oven to 350Â°F. In small bowl, mix salsa and sour cream. Spoon 1/2 of salsa mixture into another small bowl; reserve for topping. To other 1/2 of salsa mixture, stir in 1/2 of the bell pepper and all of the chicken.
To make 2 stacks, place 2 tortillas on ungreased cookie sheet; spread each with chicken mixture. Spread 2 tortillas with guacamole; place on chicken mixture. Spread 2 more tortillas with refried beans; place on guacamole. Top each stack with reserved salsa mixture, 1 tortilla, remaining bell pepper and the cheese.
Bake about 15 minutes or until cheese is melted and filling is hot. Cut each stack into 8 wedges.
