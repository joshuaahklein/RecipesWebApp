Ingredients
3-pound broiler-fryer chicken, quartered
1/2 cup Kikkoman Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce
Teriyaki-Lemon Glaze (recipe below)
Directions
Rinse chicken under cold water; pat dry with paper towels. Pour teriyaki sauce over chicken in large plastic food storage bag. Press air out of bag; close top securely. Turn bag over several times to coat all pieces well. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight, turning bag over occasionally.
Prepare Teriyaki-Lemon Glaze; keep warm.
Place chicken on grill 6 inches from hot coals and cook 40 to 45 minutes, or until no longer pink near bone, turning pieces over frequently. (Or, place chicken on rack of broiler pan. Broil 5 to 7 inches from heat source 45 minutes, or until no longer pink near bone, turning over frequently.)
To serve, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls Teriyaki-Lemon Glaze over each chicken quarter.
Teriyaki-Lemon Glaze: Combine 1/4 cup sugar, 2 Tbsp. Kikkoman Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce, 1 teaspoon grated fresh lemon peel, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, 4 teaspoons cornstarch, 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves, crumbled, and 1/2 cup water in small saucepan. Cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens.
