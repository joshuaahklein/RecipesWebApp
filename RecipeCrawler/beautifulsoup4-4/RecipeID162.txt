Ingredients
1 (8 ounce) package brownie mix
1 egg
1 tablespoon cold water
1 (14 ounce) bag caramels, unwrapped
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
Chocolate topping
Directions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. In a small bowl, mix together brownie mix, 1 egg, and water. Spread batter into the greased pan. Bake for 25 minutes. Melt the caramels with the evaporated milk over low heat in a heavy saucepan. Stir often, and heat until mixture has a smooth consistency. Reserve 1/3 cup of this caramel mixture, and pour the remainder over the warm, baked brownie crust. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese, vanilla, and sugar with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Pour cream cheese mixture over caramel mixture. Bake cheesecake for 40 minutes. Chill in pan. When cake is thoroughly chilled, loosen and then remove the rim of the pan. Heat reserved caramel mixture, and spoon over cheesecake. Drizzle with the chocolate topping.
