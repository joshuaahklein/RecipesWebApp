Ingredients
4 lobsters (1 lb. each)
5 lbs. steamers
3 yellow onions
4 cloves garlic
6 ears of corn
12 small potatoes
1 lb. Portuguese sausage (or chorizo)
1 lb. hot dogs
2 lemons
3 bottles of Samuel Adams Summer Ale
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
Rockweed seaweed (optional)
Directions
Before beginning, make sure all clams are scrubbed clean. In a big pot, layer quartered onions, garlic, crushed red pepper flakes, 2 1/2 bottles of Samuel Adams Summer Ale, ears of corn and small potatoes. Cut the Portuguese sausage into 1-inch thick pieces, and cut the hot dogs in half, lengthwise. Add the meat, cleaned clams, and lobsters to the pot and cover tightly. Let cook for 15 to 20 minutes until done. Layer on a platter, and save the remaining liquid for dipping. Serve with lemon wedges, and pair with a Samuel Adams Summer Ale.
NOTE: Ask your fishmonger for purged steamers as they have been cleaned already. You can also get the seaweed from them. Just add a layer of seaweed after the potatoes.
