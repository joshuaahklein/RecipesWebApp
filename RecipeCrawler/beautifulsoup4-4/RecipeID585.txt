Scrabble Chocolate Chip Cookies
Rating:
3
Ingredients
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 cups (12-oz. pkg.) chocolate chips
Icing:  white royal icing and black tube icing (for the letters/numbers)
Directions
Preheat oven to 375.  In a mixer, cream both kinds of sugar and vanilla.  Once creamed, add eggs individually and then the vanilla.  In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, and salt. Slowly add this dry mixture into the mixer until incorporated.  Add chocolate chips and stir in by hand.  Using your hands, smooth out the cookie dough into the bottom of two cookie sheets with sides.  It should be about 1/4&quot; - 1/2&quot; thick and cover the entire cookie sheet.  Bake for 13-20 minutes, depending on how firm you want them. I would suggest for this project to have the cookies somewhat firm.
Let the cookies cool completely.  Use a pizza cutter to cut the cookies into 1&quot; squares.  Use white icing to individually ice the top of the cookie. Let this firm up and then use the black icing to carefully write the number and letter on the cookie.
