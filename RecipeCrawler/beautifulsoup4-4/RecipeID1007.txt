1 package (9 oz) refrigerated cheese-filled tortellini
1 cup Green GiantÂ® frozen sweet peas (from 1-lb bag)
5 cups torn romaine lettuce

2 cups chopped or strips grilled chicken
1 medium red bell pepper, cut into strips
1/2 cup reduced-fat mayonnaise or salad dressing
1/2 cup basil pesto
1/4 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or basil leaves
Directions
Cook tortellini as directed on package, adding peas during last 4 minutes of cook time. Drain; rinse immediately with cold water. Pat with paper towels to remove moisture.
