Ingredients
1  24-ounce package frozen potato wedges (skins on)
2  tablespoons cooking oil
4  cloves garlic, minced
1  teaspoon smoked paprika or paprika
1/4  teaspoon salt
Nonstick cooking spray
1  cup shredded white or other cheddar cheese (4 ounces)
2/3  cup crushed croutons (about 1 cup croutons)
Dairy sour cream (optional)
Directions
1. Preheat oven according to package directions for potatoes. Place frozen potatoes in a large self-sealing plastic bag. Combine cooking oil, garlic, paprika, and salt. Drizzle over potato wedges. Seal bag and shake to coat potatoes.
2. Lightly coat a 15x10x1-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. Spread potatoes in a single layer on prepared pan. Bake potato wedges according to package directions, turning once.
3. In another small bowl combine the cheese and croutons. Sprinkle over the potatoes the last 3 minutes of baking. Use a large spatula to transfer potato wedges to a platter or large plate (keep potatoes in a single layer). Serve with sour cream, if desired.
