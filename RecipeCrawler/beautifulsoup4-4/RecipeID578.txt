1 lb ground sausage
6 oz pepperoni
1 box Kraft mac 'n' cheese
1 can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic & oregano
1 1/2 cups water
3/4 cup shredded cheese
Directions
Brown sausage in a skillet and drain thoroughly before returning to skillet.  Add the diced tomatoes and water and bring to a boil. Just when it starts to boil, add the Kraft mac, enclosed cheese mixture, and the pepperoni. Mix together well, turn the heat to medium-low, and cover with a lid/foil for 10 minutes, stirring once.  At the end of the 10 minutes, stir once more and sprinkle the cheese over the mixture.  Turn off the heat, add the lid/foil, and let stand for a few more minutes so that the cheese melts.
