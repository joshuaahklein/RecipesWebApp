Eggs with Curry Leaves
Rating:
2
Ingredients
4 large or extra large eggs
1/2 tsp salt, or to taste
1 tsp butter or ghee (we used ghee)
1 tsp raw sesame oil or vegetable oil (we used vegetable oil)
5-8 fresh or frozen curry leaves, coarsely chopped
1 tsp minced ginger or ginger mashed to a paste
1 cayenne (or serrano) chili, seeded and chopped
1/4 cup finely sliced shallots
2 scallions, minced
Directions
Whisk the eggs in a bowl until very smooth.  Whisk in salt.  Set aside.
Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the butter or ghee and the oil.  Once hot (or if you are using butter, once the butter is melted), add the curry leaves, ginger and chili.  Stir-fry briefly until fragrant.  Add shallots and scallions, reduce the heat to medium, and stir-fry until the shallots are softened, about 4 minutes.
Lower the heat to medium- low and pour eggs into the pan.  Gently scramble the eggs until just set, but still tender.  Serve.
