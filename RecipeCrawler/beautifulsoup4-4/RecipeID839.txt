Ingredients
1/2 cup Kikkoman Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 cloves garlic, pressed
3/4 teaspoon ground red pepper (cayenne)
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 whole chicken legs
Directions
Combine teriyaki marinade & sauce, lime juice, garlic, red and black pepper; pour over chicken in large plastic food storage bag. Press air out of bag; close top securely. Turn bag over several times to coat chicken well. Refrigerate overnight, turning bag over occasionally.
Cook chicken on grill, 8 to 10 inches from medium-hot coals, 30 to 35 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink in center, turning over occasionally. (Or, place chicken, skin side down, on rack of broiler pan. Broil, 10 to 12 inches from heat source, 20 minutes. Turn chicken over and cook 15 to 17 minutes longer, or until chicken is no longer pink in center.)
