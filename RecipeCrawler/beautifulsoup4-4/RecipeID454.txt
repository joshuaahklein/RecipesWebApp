Ingredients
4 Cornish game hens
2 boxes long grain wild rice Rice-A-Roni
3 cans chicken broth
2 sticks butter
Minced garlic
Salt
Pepper
White pearl onions
Directions
Cook rice according to package directions, substituting chicken broth for water.  Adding minced garlic adds another dimension of flavor.  Allow rice to cool.
While rice is cooling, preheat oven to 400 degrees and wash hens.  Spoon and stuff hen cavities with rice mixture until full.  Tie legs together.
Place hens inside roasting pan breast side up.  Once all hens are stuffed and placed in pan, add additional chicken broth (up to 1 whole can.)  Melt 1 stick of butter and pour over the tops of all hens until they are fully covered.  Apply salt and pepper to taste and add pearl onions, washed and cut in half, in the chicken broth mixture.
Cook hens COVERED for 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes remove lid and continue cooking for an additional 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until fully cooked.
