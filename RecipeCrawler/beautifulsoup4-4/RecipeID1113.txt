Rating:
3
Ingredients
2 tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus 1 tsp, separated
1/2 tsp meyer lemon zest
1/2 tsp dill, finely chopped
1/2 tsp thyme, picked and finely chopped
1/2 tsp garlic, minced
s&p;
2 (6-ounce) salmon fillets, skin-on
1-2 tbsp olive oil
Directions
In a small bowl, combine the 2 tbsp butter, lemon zest, herbs and garlic.  Mix until everything is well mixed.  Season, to taste, with salt.  Set aside.
Heat 1-2 tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the oil is almost smoking.  Add 1 tsp butter.  Season the salmon on both sides with s&p.; Add the salmon to the pan, skin-side down. To get super crispy skin, cook the salmon almost to completion, about 6 minutes.
Flip the salmon and cook until flesh side is nicely seared, 1 to 2 minutes (if your salmon is thicker than 1 1/2-2 inches you can cook them another minute or two flesh-side down).
Remove from the pan and top with the room temperature compound butter.  The butter will melt over and coat the salmon.
