Ingredients
1 (1 pound) loaf Italian bread
5 Tablespoons butter, softened
2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon dried oregano salt and pepper-to taste
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
Directions
Preheat the broiler.  Cut the bread into 1 to 2 inches thick slices.  In a small bowl, mix butter, olive oil, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper.  Spread the misture evenly on the bread slices.  On a medium baking sheet, arrange the slices evenly and broil 5 minutes, or until slightly brown.  Check frequently so they do not burn.  Remove from broiler.  Top with cheese and return to broiler for 2-3 minutes, until cheese is slightly brown and melted.  Serve at once.
