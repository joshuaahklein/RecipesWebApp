Ingredients
2/3 C. orange juice concentrate
1 C. water
1 C. milk
1/2 tsp. vanilla
1/4 C. powdered sugar
6 ice cubes (approx 1 1/2 cups ice
Directions
Put all ingredients in a blender, cover and blend until smooth.
Servings: 8 - 1/2 cups
Hints:
If you already have premixed orange juice, use 1 2/3 cups of that
instead of the concentrate and water. If your ice cubes are from a tray, you may want to pre-crush them a bit as the ice blends better if it isn't in too large of pieces.
