Ingredients
Ingredients for Teriyaki marinade:
1/3 cup water
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Optional: I have ground ginger in my fridge so I actually used 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger & 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic.
Ingredients for complete meal:
1 lb chicken breast, cut into strips
1 20 oz can pineapple tidbits
1/2 cup diced green peppers
2 cups cooked rice, for serving
Directions
Mix all marinade ingredients together in a resealable container. Once mixed, toss in the chicken strips and stir to coat the strips. Place in the fridge and forget about it for a couple hours or a day.  When you are ready to make the meal, heat a skillet to medium heat and add the chicken strips, half a can of the tidbits (use more if you wish or save the other half of the can for a snack), and the green peppers. I would add about 1/2 to 3/4 of the teriyaki marinade into the skillet (see note below). This will provide a nice amount of sauce to go over the rice. Mix the chicken around until all pieces are cooked through (white throughout). Place a mound of rice on your plate and a spoonful of the chicken teriyaki on top.
