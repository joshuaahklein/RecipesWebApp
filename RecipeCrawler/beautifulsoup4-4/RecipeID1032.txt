Pork chops on the grill? Do them differently this time. This seasoning-glaze combo keeps your meal low-fat and quick while adding maple syrup sweetness.
Ingredients
1/4 cup real maple syrup
1/4 cup apple butter
1/2 teaspoon ground mustard
4 pork bone-in loin chops, 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, trimmed of fat
1/2 teaspoon garlic pepper blend
1/4 teaspoon salt
Directions
Heat coals or gas grill for direct heat. In 1-quart saucepan, mix maple syrup, apple butter and mustard. Cook over low heat about 1 minute, stirring occasionally, until well blended.
Sprinkle pork chops with garlic pepper and salt. Place pork on grill. Brush with maple mixture. Cover and grill over medium heat 10 to 12 minutes, turning and brushing with maple mixture 2 or 3 times, until no longer pink when cut near bone. Discard any remaining maple mixture.
