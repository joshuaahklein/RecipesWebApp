Ingredients
1/4 lb. new potatoes
1/4 Pizza Dough
1 clove garlic, minced
1 Tbsp. olive oil
4 green onions, thinly sliced, divided
3/4 cup Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
1/4 lb. fresh asparagus spears, trimmed, cut lengthwise in half, then crosswise into 3-inch lengths
2 Tbsp. Shredded Parmesan Cheese
3 oz. Cream Cheese
Directions
Heat oven to 450ÂºF.
Cook potatoes in boiling water 15 min. or just until tender. (Do not overcook.) Drain potatoes; rinse with cold water to cool completely. Drain potatoes again; cut into thin slices.
Roll Perfect Parmesan Pizza Dough into 12-inch circle on lightly floured surface. Press onto bottom of 12-inch pizza pan sprayed with cooking spray, stretching dough as necessary to fit. Let stand 10 min. Meanwhile, mix garlic and oil.
Spread pizza crust with half the garlic oil; top with half the onions and mozzarella. Toss asparagus with remaining garlic oil; spread over pizza. Top with potatoes, Parmesan and cream cheese, broken into pieces.
Bake 15 to 18 min. or until crust is golden brown. Sprinkle with remaining onions.
