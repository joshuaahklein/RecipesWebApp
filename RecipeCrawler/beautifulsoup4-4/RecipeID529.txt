Ingredients
12 oz. regular or hot bulk pork sausage
1/2 cup chopped onion
4 large eggs
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
18 Ritz crackers, crushed (about 1/2 cup crumbs)
1 tsp. dried basil
1/2 tsp. dried oregano
1/8 tsp. ground pepper
1 clove garlic, finely minced
1 lb. zucchini (about 2 large), shredded
1 cup shredded Italian four-cheese blend
Directions
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Saute sausage and onion in a medium skillet until all pink is gone; drain fat.  Whist eggs in a large bowl until frothy.  Stir in Parmesan cheese, cracker crumbs, basil, oregano, pepper, garlic, sausage, and zucchini.
Spoon into a greased 7 x 11-inch (2 qt.) baking dish, spreading the top smooth.  Bake for 25 minutes.  Sprinkle the top with Italian four-cheese blend and bake for an additional 15 minutes.  Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares.
(Squares may be refrigerated overnight or frozen.  Reheat at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.)
