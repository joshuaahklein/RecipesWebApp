Ingredients
1/2 cup Kikkoman Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce
2 tablespoons honey
4 teaspoons Dijon-style mustard
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3 pounds pork spareribs, cut into 1-rib portions
Directions
Combine teriyaki marinade & sauce, honey, mustard and garlic in large bowl; add spareribs and toss until pieces are thoroughly coated. Reserving sauce, remove ribs and place, meaty side up, in 9x13-inch microwave-safe baking dish. Let stand 10 minutes.
Cover and microwave on medium-high (70%) 14 minutes, rotating dish once.
Meanwhile, prepare coals for grilling.
Remove ribs and place on grill 4 to 5 inches from medium-hot coals; brush with reserved sauce. Cook ribs 8 to 10 minutes, turning and brushing occasionally with remaining sauce. (Or, place ribs on rack of broiler pan; brush with reserved sauce. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat 6 minutes on each side; brush once with remaining sauce).
