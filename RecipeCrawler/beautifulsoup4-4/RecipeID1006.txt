Ingredients
1 cup uncooked farro (semi-pearled or pearled)
1 lb fresh asparagus spears
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 shallot, finely chopped
1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon peel (1/2 medium)
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice (1/2 medium)
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup pecans
1/3 cup feta cheese
Directions
In 2-quart saucepan, heat 4 cups water to boiling. Stir in farro; return to boiling. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook 20 to 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut asparagus into 1-inch pieces, leaving heads full. In 10-inch skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil. Add asparagus and shallot; cook 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until desired doneness (some like asparagus more tender, while others prefer a little fresh crunch). Remove asparagus from skillet to plate; set aside.
Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons oil, the lemon peel and lemon juice to skillet. Heat over low heat, scraping bottom of skillet with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. Stir in salt and pepper. Set sauce aside.
Drain cooked faro in strainer or colander; rinse. In large serving bowl, toss faro with asparagus, pecans and feta cheese. Drizzle sauce over top.
