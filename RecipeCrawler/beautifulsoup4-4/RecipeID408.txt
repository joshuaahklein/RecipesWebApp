Ingredients
1/2  cup water
1  envelope unflavored gelatin
1  8-ounce package cream cheese or reduced-fat cream cheese (Neufchatel), softened
1  12-ounce carton cranberry-strawberry or cranberry-raspberry crushed fruit
1/4  cup chopped pecans
Sugared cranberries* (optional)
Sugared fresh basil leaves* (optional)
Directions
1. In a 1-cup glass measure, stir together water and gelatin; let stand for 5 minutes to soften.
2. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, beat cream cheese with an electric mixer on low to medium speed until smooth. Beat in crushed fruit and pecans; set aside.
3. In a medium saucepan containing 1 inch water, place the glass measure with gelatin mixture. Heat until gelatin dissolves, stirring constantly.
4. Stir gelatin into cranberry mixture. Pour mixture into a 3 1/2- or 4-cup mold or divide it among eight 4-ounce gelatin molds. Cover and chill for at least 4 hours or until firm. Unmold salad onto a serving plate or individual salad plates. If desired, garnish with sugared cranberries and basil. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
5. *Note: To make sugared cranberries and basil leaves, sprinkle berries and leaves with water. Roll in sugar, turning to coat evenly.
