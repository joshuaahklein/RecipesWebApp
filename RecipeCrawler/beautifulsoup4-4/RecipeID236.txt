Cheesy Bean Dip
Rating:
2
Ingredients
1 can refried beans
1 packet taco seasoning
1 tub sour cream
1 pkg shredded cheddar cheese
1 big tomato
1 small can olives
1 bunch chives
Directions
Step 1: Dice the tomato (I usually scoop out the seeds so the dip doesn’t become runny) and mince the chives (for garnish). Set aside.
Step 2: Next, mix the taco seasoning into the beans until combined evenly then spread the mixture at the bottom of a casserole dish.
Step 3: Layers: Spread the sour cream directly on top of the beans and follow that with a sprinkle of a nice heaping layer of cheese (about half the package). Then evenly distribute the tomatoes and olives (and bacon bits if you have some on hand) on top of the cheese. Finish this off by sprinkling the rest of the cheese on top.
Step 4: Pop this bad boy into the oven at 350 degrees for about 5 minutes or until the cheese is nice and gooey. Garnish with chopped chives.
