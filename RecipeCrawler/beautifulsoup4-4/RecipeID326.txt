Ingredients
1/4  cup wild rice
1-3/4  cups water
1/4  cup brown rice
1  teaspoon instant chicken bouillon granules
1/8  to 1/4 teaspoon ground sage or nutmeg
2  cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2  cup chopped celery (1 stalk)
1/3  cup sliced green onion (3)
1/2  cup sliced almonds or pine nuts, toasted
Directions
1. Rinse uncooked wild rice in a strainer under cold water about 1 minute; drain. In a medium saucepan combine wild rice, the 1 3/4 cups water, uncooked brown rice, bouillon granules, and sage. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.
2. Add mushrooms, celery, and green onion. Cook, covered, over medium-low heat about 25 minutes more or until vegetables are just tender, stirring frequently. If desired, stir in almonds. Serve immediately, or cool and use to stuff a 3-1/2- to 4-pound broiler-fryer chicken (see stuffing tips). Makes 6 servings.
3. Make-ahead directions: Prepare as above through step 2. Transfer stuffing to a 1-quart casserole. Cover and chill for up to 24 hours. Stir in 1/4 cup water. Bake, covered, in a 375 degree F oven about 30 minutes or until heated through
