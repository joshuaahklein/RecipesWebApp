Ingredients
1 lb. Jimmy Dean hot sausage
4-6 large Russet potatoes
1 lb. mixed vegetables, frozen
2 cans cream of chicken soup
shredded Mozzarella or Cheddar cheese
salt/pepper to taste
Directions
Preheat oven to 400-degrees F.  Brown sausage in skillet.  Once brown, leave to cool some.  While sausage is cooling, wash, peel, and cube 4 to 6 large Russet potatoes into 1/2-inch to 1-inch pieces.
Put browned sausage into a large bowl.  Add frozen vegetables and 2 cans of cream of chicken soup.  Mix together thoroughly until well mixed.  Pour mixture into a 9x13-inch glass casserole dish.  Spread on bottom until an even layer coats the entire bottom of the dish.
Take the cubed potato pieces and pour them over the top of the casserole mixture already in the dish.  Spread them around until they are evenly distributed on the top of the casserole.
Place the casserole into the already preheated oven for 1 hour.  Then take the casserole out and cover the top of the potatoes with shredded cheese.  Place back in the oven for an additional 10 minutes.
