Radish Sliver Omelet
Rating:
1
Ingredients
10 oz daikon radish
s&p
5 scallions, green parts only, finely sliced
3 tbsp peanut oil
Directions
Peel the radish and cut it into very thin slices, and then in very thin slivers (we used a mandoline to cut the thin slices and then a knife to cut the slivers).  Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp salt, mix well, and leave to drain for 30 minutes in a colander.
Remove daikon slivers and squeeze to remove as much moisture as possible.  Heat the peanut oil in a nonstick skillet
