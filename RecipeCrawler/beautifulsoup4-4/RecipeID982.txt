These breaded chicken breasts are crispy and brown on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The seasoned crumbs add extra flavor.
Ingredients
4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves (1 lb)
1/4 cup ranch dressing
1/3 cup Progresso dry bread crumbs (any flavor)
2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
Directions
Dip chicken into dressing, then coat with bread crumbs.
In 10-inch skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in oil 12 to 15 minutes, turning once, until outside is golden brown and juice is no longer pink when centers of thickest pieces are cut.
