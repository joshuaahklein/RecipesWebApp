Presented as pretty pinwheels, popular nacho flavors are rolled into soft tortillas and sliced.
Ingredients
4 spinach-flavored or plain flour tortillas, 8 to 10 inches in diameter
1/2 cup bean dip
1/2 cup nacho cheese dip
3 to 4 tablespoons chopped green onions or chopped fresh cilantro
Directions
Spread each tortilla with about 2 tablespoons bean dip and 2 tablespoons cheese dip. Sprinkle each with onions.
Tightly roll up tortillas; wrap individually in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 1 hour but no longer than 24 hours. To serve, cut off ends from each roll and discard. Cut rolls into 1/2- to 3/4-inch slices. Secure with toothpicks if desired.
