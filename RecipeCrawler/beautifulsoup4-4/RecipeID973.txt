1/4 cup milk
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon caraway seed (optional)

Directions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Let beer stand until flat, about 20-30 minutes. Spray 9&quot; cake pan with cooking spray then line bottom of pan with parchment paper. In a large bowl combine flour, sugar, baking powder, caraway seeds, and salt. Stir in raisins. Stir in beer, milk, butter, and one egg until a dough forms. On a floured surface, knead dough until smooth. Shape into round loaf. Cut a 1/2&quot; deep X into the top of the bread. Lightly beat remaining egg and brush over dough. Bake 55 minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped on bottom. Remove from pan and cool on rack. Eat warm for best taste!
