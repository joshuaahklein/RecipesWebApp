Rating:
3
Ingredients
Oven-Dried Tomatoes, halved
1/4 cup agrodolce
basil pesto
1 ball of burrata or fresh mozzarella, sliced (or cut/torn into chunks because that's about all you can do with burrata)
Directions
Combine the tomatoes and agrodolce in a small bowl, mixing well.  Set aside.
Put the pesto in a small bowl.  Toss mozzarella in the pesto, coating it generously, and divide among salad plates (or serve on one large platter).  Divide tomatoes among plates (or on a platter) and serve.
