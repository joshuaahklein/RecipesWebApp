Ingredients
2  cups graham cracker crumbs
1/2  cup finely chopped pecans
1/4  cup sugar
1/2  cup butter, melted
3  8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened
3/4  cup sugar
1  teaspoon vanilla
3  eggs
1  cup mashed bananas (about 2 medium)
1  8-ounce carton dairy sour cream
2  tablespoons white creme de cacao
2  tablespoons dark rum
1-1/2  cups flaked coconut, toasted
Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degree F. For crust, in a medium bowl combine graham crackers, pecans, and 1/4 cup sugar. Stir in melted butter. Press crumb mixture onto the bottom of a 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Set aside.
2. For filling, in a large mixing bowl beat cream cheese, 3/4 cup sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixture until combined. Add eggs all at once, beating on low speed just until combined. Stir in mashed bananas. Pour filling into crust-lined pan. Bake for 30 minutes or until center is set.
3. Meanwhile, in a small bowl stir together the sour cream, creme de cacao, and rum. Spoon sour cream mixture over filling, spreading evenly; bake for 5 minutes more. (Sour cream layer may crack slightly). Cool in pan on a wire rack. Cover and chill for 4 to 24 hours. To serve, sprinkle with toasted coconut. Makes 20 servings.
