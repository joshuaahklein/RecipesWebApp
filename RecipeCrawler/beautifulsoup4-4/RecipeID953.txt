Dover Sole Almondine with Brussels Sprouts
Rating:
5
Ingredients
2 tbsp vegetable oil, separated
10 oz shredded Brussels Sprouts (we used our mandoline, but you can buy them preshredded at Trader Joe's)
2 Dover sole fillets (ours weighed about 3 oz each)
all-purpose flour
2 tbsp unsalted butter, separated
2 tbsp sliced almonds
2 tsp fresh lemon juice
2 tsp white wine
Directions
Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tbsp vegetable oil and swirl to coat. Add Brussels sprouts and season lightly with s&p. Saute, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a warm platter and set aside. Wipe out the skillet.
While the Brussels sprouts are sauteing, pat fish dry and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Lightly dredge filets in flour, knocking off any excess. Set aside.
Return the skillet to medium-high heat. Add remaining 1 tbsp vegetable oil and 1 tbsp butter. Wait until foam subsides before adding the fish. Cook fish, flipping carefully once, until browned and just cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes total. Add fish to platter with Brussels sprouts.
Reduce heat to medium-low. If a lot of oil/butter remains in the pan, discard all but 1 tbsp. Add almonds and remaining 1 tbsp butter and cook, stirring, until almonds and butter are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice and white wine. Season with s&p. Spoon almond mixture over fish and Brussels sprouts.
Serve.
