Ultimate Pulled Pork

Ingredients
2 – 2 ½ lbs pork loin
1 bottle barbecue sauce
2 tablespoons mustard
1 tablespoon each Worcestershire & ketchup
1 ½ teaspoon chili powder
salt and pepper
Directions
Spray slow cooker with PAM liberally.  The pork loin usually comes split in half. I like to cut mine in half crosswise so that the pulled pieces aren’t so long.  Place the pork down in the crockpot and then mix all the ingredients on top of it.  I actually make this the night before and let it marinate overnight in the fridge. Then turn it on in the morning and cook it for about 6 hours on low.  I've found that it's better not to cook it for longer than 6 hours or you could burn it and no one wants burnt pulled pork.  When it is done, use two forks to pull it apart. Spoon the mixture over it and let it sit for 5 minutes more before serving.
