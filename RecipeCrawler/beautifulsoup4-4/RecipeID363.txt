Ingredients
1-3/4  cups finely crushed graham crackers (about 25 squares)
1  7-1/2-ounce package almond brickle pieces, finely chopped (about 1-1/2 cups)
1/2  cup butter, melted
3  8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened
3/4  cup packed brown sugar
2  tablespoons all-purpose flour
3  eggs
1/4  cup milk
Thinly sliced apple (optional)
Directions
For crust, in a mixing bowl combine graham crackers and 1/3 cup of the chopped brickle pieces. Stir in melted butter. Press onto bottom and 2 inches up sides of an 8- or 9-inch springform pan.
In a medium mixing bowl combine the cream cheese, brown sugar, and flour. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Add the eggs all at once, beating on low just until combined. Stir in the milk and 2/3 cup brickle pieces. Pour mixture into prepared pan. Place on a shallow baking pan in oven.
Bake in a 375 degree F oven until center appears nearly set when shaken, allowing 45 to 50 minutes for the 8-inch pan or 35 to 40 minutes for the 9-inch pan. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Loosen sides. Cool 30 minutes more. Remove sides; cool completely. Cover and chill 4 hours or until serving time
Before serving, place the cheesecake on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with remaining brickle pieces (about 1/2 cup). Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat for 1 to 3 minutes or until pieces begin to melt and form a crust. Transfer to a serving plate. Slice to serve. If desired, garnish with apple slices. Makes 12 to 16 servings
Make-Ahead Tip: Prepare, bake, and cool the cheesecake. Cover and chill 4 hours ahead. Broil on the topping before serving.
