Ingredients
Topping:
1 cup sugar & 1 tablespoon cinnamon
Cookie Dough:
3 1/2 cups flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon each salt & cinnamon
1 1/2 sticks butter
2 cups sugar
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
2 eggs
2 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup each dried cherries (cut in half) and sliced almonds
Directions
Mix topping ingredients together and set aside.  Stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon together and set aside. In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Continue to mix, adding eggs, corn syrup and vanilla; mix thoroughly.  Add the dry ingredients, dried cherries and sliced almonds to the bowl and mix until blended.  If the dough is sticky or difficult to handle, wrap and chill the dough for an hour. The dough tends to be pretty crumbly but I have always been able to make it into balls quite easily.
Roll balls of dough (about the size of a walnut) and roll in the cinnamon sugar topping to coat. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet about 2 1/2 inches apart. You do not need to press these down until little disks; just leave them as little balls.  Bake for 10-12 minutes (less is better!) in a 375 degree oven until the cookies puff slightly and the surface is slightly cracked. Let cool on a cookie sheet a few minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool.
