Rating:
4
Ingredients
1 kohlrabi (about 14 oz) (or you can substitute daikon)
1 1/4 tsp salt
2 tbsp finely sliced scallions, green parts only
For sauce
1 tsp light soy sauce
1 tsp garlic, finely chopped
1 tsp Chinkiang vinegar
1/4 tsp sugar
1 tsp sesame oil
Directions
Peel the kohlrabi and cut it into very thin slices.  Cut the slices into very thin slivers.  PLace in a bowl, add the salt and mix well, scrunching with your hands to squeeze the salt into the kohlrabi shreds.  Set aside for at least 10 minutes.
Drain off the water that will have emerged from the kohlrabi and squeeze the slivers as dry as possible.  Add all the sauce ingredients, mix well, then serve with the scallion greens scattered on top.
