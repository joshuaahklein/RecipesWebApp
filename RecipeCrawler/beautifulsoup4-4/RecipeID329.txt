Ingredients
1  cup finely chopped celery
1/2  cup chopped onion (1 medium)
1/2  cup margarine or butter
1/2  cup chopped, cooked poultry giblets*
1  teaspoon poultry seasoning or ground sage
1/4  teaspoon pepper
1/8  teaspoon salt
4  cups dry bread cubes
4  cups dry corn bread cubes
1 to 1-1/3  cups chicken broth or water
Directions
1. In a small saucepan cook celery and onion in margarine or butter until tender; remove from heat. Stir in giblets, poultry seasoning or sage, pepper, and salt.
2. In a large mixing bowl place dry bread and corn bread cubes; add the onion mixture. Drizzle with enough broth or water to moisten, tossing lightly to mix. Transfer to a 2-quart casserole. Cover and bake in a 325 degree F oven for 40 minutes or until heated through. (Or, use to stuff a 10- to 12-pound turkey; see directions for Classic Roast Turkey.) Makes 8 cups (10 to 12 servings).
Note: To cook giblets: Rinse giblets and neck. Refrigerate liver until needed. In a medium saucepan place remaining giblets and neck. Add enough lightly salted water to cover. Bring to boiling. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 1 hour. Add liver and simmer 20 to 30 minutes or until tender. Remove giblets and finely chop. Discard neck. Strain broth. Chill giblets and broth until needed.
