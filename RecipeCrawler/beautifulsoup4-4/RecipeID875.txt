Ingredients
6 to 7-pound fully cooked smoked butt- or shank-half ham*
1/4 cup minced shallots
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 jar (10 oz.) apple jelly
3/4 cup Kikkoman Sweet & Sour Sauce
1/3 cup sweetened dried cranberries
Directions
Place ham, fatty side up, on rack in shallow roasting pan.
Bake in 325ºF. 20 to 25 minutes per pound, or until meat thermometer inserted in center, away from bone, reads 135º. Let ham stand 10 minutes before slicing.
Meanwhile, sauté shallots in hot oil in medium saucepan over medium heat 3 minutes, or until translucent. Add apple jelly; cook, stirring, 3 minutes, or until jelly melts. Stir in sweet & sour sauce and cranberries; cover and cook 1 minute until heated, stirring once.
Serve sauce with ham slices.
*Note: If desired, use fully cooked, center-cut ham slice (about 1-1/4-lb.). Heat ham according to package directions. To prepare sauce:
Sauté 1 Tbsp. minced shallot in 1 teaspoon hot vegetable oil in small saucepan.
Stir in 1/4 cup each Kikkoman Sweet & Sour Sauce and apple jelly, and 2 Tbsp. sweetened dried cranberries; cook, covered, 2 minutes, or until jelly melts, stirring occasionally.
Cut ham into serving portions and serve with sauce. Makes 4 servings.
