Ingredients
7 tablespoons butter, divided
16 ounces sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup chopped green onion
1/4 cup minced shallot
3 cloves garlic, minced
16 ounces frozen chopped spinach, thawed,squeezed dry
1 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 lasagna noodles
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup flour
1 1/4 cups chicken broth or vegetable broth
1 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup dry white vermouth
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1 lb jarlsberg cheese or provolone cheese or havarti cheese, shredded
1/4 lb smoked gouda cheese, shredded
1/4 cup half-and-half
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
Directions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package directions; drain, rinse immediately with cold water and then drain again; toss with 1 Tbsp olive oil and set aside.
Melt 2 tablespoon butter in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat; add the mushrooms and cook until golden, about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium and add the green onions, shallots, and garlic, and sauté for 3 minutes.
Add the drained, chopped spinach, white pepper, and salt, stir well and sauté for an additional 5 minutes.
Transfer the mushroom/spinach mixture to a bowl and set aside (do not rinse out this pan - we're going to use it again in the upcoming steps).
Over medium heat melt the remaining butter in the previously-used saucepan; add the flour and cook, stirring constantly to keep it from browning.
Gradually add the chicken or vegetable broth, cream, and vermouth; cook, stirring occasionally, until smooth and thickened, about 5 minutes.
As soon as sauce begins to boil, remove it from the heat and season with thyme and basil.
Combine the shredded cheeses together until well mixed.
Butter, oil, or lightly spray the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Pour the half-and-half into the bottom of the baking pan.
Lay 4 cooked noodles in a single layer in the pan.
Layer with 1/3 each of the mushroom/spinach mixture and shredded cheeses, then coat with 1/3 of the sauce.
Repeat the process twice, ending with the sauce.
Sprinkle with grated Parmesan (if using).
Cover the pan with foil and bake at 350F for 20 minutes, then remove foil and bake 20 minutes longer.
Remove from oven and let sit 15 minutes before serving.
