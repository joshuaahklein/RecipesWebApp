6-10 jumbo shrimp
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

Directions
For the bean mixture, cook the bacon in a saucepan for 5 minutes over medium heat until the bacon fat starts releasing. Add the onions and stir for 2 minutes. Add the black beans and cover with water. Cook until the beans are soft, refilling with water when necessary. In a hot sauce pan, sear the shrimp in olive oil on both sides until cooked through (~ 3 min per side). Spill oil out of pan, add BBQ sauce and coat shrimp.
