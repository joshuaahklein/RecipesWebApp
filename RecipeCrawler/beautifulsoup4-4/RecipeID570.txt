Ingredients
Red or yukon gold potatoes
4 strips bacon, crumbled
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
Kraft Zesty Italian dressing
Directions
Scrub potatoes and pat dry on a towel. Using a fork, prick the top of the potato about 5-7 times. If you've had a rough day, feel free to take out the anger on the potato! Place the potatoes in a 9x9 or similar glass baking dish; then add about 1/3&quot; inch of water to the bottom of the dish. Microwave for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, fry off bacon until crispy. Remove bacon and crumble; discard bacon drippings from skillet.
Once the microwave goes off, the real fun begins.  Place one potato on a flat surface and use the bottom of a plate to 'smash' the potato to about 1/2-3/4&quot;.  The potato may break apart a little bit but it will mostly stay intact.
Squirt a tablespoon or so of Zesty Italian dressing into the skillet and allow it to heat up for a minute. Place your smashed potatoes over the dressing and allow to cook for about 4 minutes.
Once browned and cooked on that side, flip it over with a large spatula. You may need to add a small drop or two of dressing under each when you flip it. Once all are flipped, add a small bit of cheese and bacon on top. Cook for 4 minutes on this side and then serve.  You will be surprised at how much flavor the Zesty Italian dressing adds.
