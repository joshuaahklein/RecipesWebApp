Mustard-Crusted Salmon
Rating:
0
Ingredients
6-inch piece of baguette, crusts removed and torn into rough chunks.
2 boneless salmon filets, about 6 ounces each
s&p
1 tbsp unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for the salmon
1 tsp Dijon mustard
1 tsp whole grain Dijon mustard
1 tsp fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped
1 tsp vegetable oil
Directions
Preheat the broiler to high and adjust rack to 6 inches below the element (we used the broiler in our toaster oven).  Pulse bread in the bowl of a food processor until coarse crumbs are created.  Season the salmon with s&p.  Set aside.
In a medium bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, 1 tbsp butter, mustard, and thyme.  Using a fork, stir and mash the mixture together until the butter is incorporated. Season with s&p.
Spread the skin of each fillet of salmon with a thin layer of butter.  Season with salt.  Heat a medium broiler-safe skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes.  Add 1 tsp vegetable oil.  Add salmon buttered-side down and cook without moving until the skin is nice and crispy and golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Pile the crumbs on the salmon, then transfer to the broiler.   Broil until the crumbs are crunchy and browned, 3-4 minutes.  Watch the salmon to make sure the bread crumbs don't burn.
Serve immediately.
