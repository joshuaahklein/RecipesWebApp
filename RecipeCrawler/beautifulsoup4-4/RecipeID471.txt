2 Bottles of Samuel Adams Boston Lager
4 (1/2 pound) beef rib-eye steaks
2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons lemon pepper
Directions
Rinse the steaks and place them in a large sealable container. Sprinkle each side of the steaks with the salt and lemon pepper. Gently pour Samuel Adams Boston Lager over the steaks (making sure the seasoning doesn't wash off). Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.
Preheat grill for high heat. Lightly oil grate. Place steaks on grill and cook for 3 to 5 minutes per side or until desired doneness is reached.
