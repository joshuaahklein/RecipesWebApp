Ingredients
Nonstick cooking spray
1-1/3  cups all-purpose flour
2/3  cup yellow cornmeal
2  Tbsp. granulated sugar
2  Tbsp. packed brown sugar
1-1/2  tsp. baking powder
1/4  tsp. baking soda
1/3  cup cold butter, cut up
1/2  cup buttermilk
1  egg
1-1/2  tsp. finely shredded lime peel
1  cup frozen blueberries*
1  tsp. cornstarch
3  to 4 tsp. lime juice
1  cup powdered sugar
3  Tbsp. chopped almonds, toasted
Directions
1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray; set aside.
2. In a large bowl combine flour, cornmeal, granulated sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cut in butter until flour mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in center. Combine buttermilk, egg, and peel; add all at once to flour mixture. Stir with a fork just until moistened.
3. Toss berries with cornstarch to coat; add to flour mixture. Stir gently 3 to 5 turns, just until berries are incorporated (do not overmix). Using a large spoon, drop dough into 12 mounds on baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between mounds. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until tops are golden. For icing, in a small bowl whisk enough lime juice into powdered sugar until drizzling consistency. Drizzle over warm scones. Sprinkle with nuts. Serve warm. Makes 12 scones.
4. *Leave berries in the freezer until ready to toss with cornstarch.
