Ingredients
12 oz Boston Ale
2 cups all purpose flour
1 tea spoon baking powder
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
½ teaspoon cumin
½ teaspoon smoke paprika
4 6-8 oz fillets of fresh caught cod
Oil for frying (vegetable or canola)
Kosher salt, cracked pepper
Directions
Combine 1st 7 ingredients in a shallow bowl and whisk until smooth. Heat oil in a dutch oven to 350-360 degrees. Dip cod in batter shaking off any extra and fry ( 2 fillets at a time only)until golden brown turning occasionally so both sides cook evenly (about 7-10 minutes). Remove to a paper town and season immediately with Kosher salt and fresh pepper. Serve with Malt Vinegar and lemon wedge (never ketchup!) and Cape Cod Sea Salt and Vinegar chips. Pairs great with the Lemony flavor of Sam Summer Ale, Boston Ale or Boston Lager.
