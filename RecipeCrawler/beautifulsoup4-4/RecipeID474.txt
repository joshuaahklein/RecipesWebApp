Rating:
5
Ingredients
4 Tb. oil
2 pounds beef short ribs
salt and pepper
2 Bottles Samuel Adams® Scotch Ale
1 can (24 oz.) tomato puree
1 large white onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
½ cup honey
½ cup molasses
Directions
Pat beef ribs with a paper towel, and liberally coat with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pan, and cook ribs in batches, until brown on all sides. Remove ribs from pan and pour off most of the oil, leaving a little. Add onion and garlic, and cook until brown. In a separate bowl, whisk together, beer, tomato puree, honey, and molasses. Put ribs back in pan and pour beer mixture over. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat for as long as possible, but at least 2 hours (the longer the time, the more tender the meat.) Remove ribs from braising liquid, and keep warm.
