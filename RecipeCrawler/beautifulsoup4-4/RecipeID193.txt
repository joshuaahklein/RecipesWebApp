1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. nutmeg
1/4 tsp. cinnamon
In another bowl, combine:

Add wet ingredients to dry, and stir only to combine (do not over mix!). Fill muffin tins 2/3 full and bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt 1/2 cup margarine or butter and set aside.

Take muffins out, and while they're still hot, dip in melted margarine and then in cinnamon sugar mixture.
