Ajam Seitan (Devilled Chicken)
Rating:
3
Ingredients
3 deboned organic chicken thighs
Salt
1 tbsp mustard
1/2 lemon
2 small onions
2 cloves garlic
1 tsp sambal oelek (or chilli paste)
4 tbsp (stir fry) oil
3 tbsp ketjap manis (or regular soy sauce plus a pinch of sugar)
Directions
Season the chicken thighs with salt and thoroughly coat with the mustard. Roll them up again and keep covered in the fridge until ready to use.
Juice the lemon. Peel the onions and garlic and slice the onion finely. Mince the garlic.
Mix the onion, garlic, lemon juice and sambal thoroughly.
Heat 3 tbsp oil in a frying pan and brown the chicken thighs on all sides for about 4 minutes, until golden brown.  Remove the chicken from the pan, add 1 tbsp oil and fry the onion-sambal mix over a low heat until the onion is tinged yellow.  Add the chicken back to the pan, along with the ketjap manis and 1 tbsp water, and bake the chicken for 12 minutes over a low heat until cooked (turning regularly and basting with the sauce). Most of the juices of the sauce should have evaporated by the end of the cooking time.
Serve the chicken with the onion sauce spooned over it. Serve yellow rice (rice with 1 tsp of turmeric added to the cooking water) and cucumber salad on the side.
