Ingredients
1 cup Samuel Adams Boston Lager
1 cup miso paste (or soy paste)
1 cup low sodium soy sauce
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 pounds boneless chicken breasts
Directions
In a large bowl, combine the miso paste, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil and cayenne pepper. Mix together well until all the miso and sugar is dissolved. Submerge the chicken in the marinade, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove the chicken from the marinade and transfer the marinade to a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring just to a boil, reduce heat and let simmer. Grill the chicken over medium high heat and baste with the boiled marinade while grilling. Chicken should take 5 to 10 minutes per side depending on thickness. The chicken is done when its juices run clear.
