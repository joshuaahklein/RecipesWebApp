Ingredients
1 (14 pound) roast-ready prime rib roast (ribs cut off and tied to roast)
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
Directions
Remove prime rib from refrigerator and allow the meat to come to room temperature, about 3 hours depending on the size of the roast.  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil.  Unwrap the roast and place onto roasting pan; blot with paper towels.  Sift together flour, pepper, salt paprika, onion powder, garlic powder and celery seed into a small bowl.  Coat the roast with the flower mixture.  Roast in preheated oven until cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 4 1/2 hours (20 minutes per pound) for medium-rare.  Roast to an internal temperature of 120 degrees F for med-rare; 130 degrees F for med: or 140 degrees F for well-done.  When roast has finished cooking, take it out of the oven, and cover with aluminum foil.  Allow to rest in a warm spot for 30 minutes to 1 hour before slicing.
