Ingredients
3 pounds of big game burger
3 medium onions (chopped)
3 medium green peppers (chopped)
1 cup celery (chopped)
2 tablespoons bacon fat or vegetable oil (Not needed if using regular burger, it has more fat than needed)
1 can (28 ounces) of Rotel diced tomatoes & green chilies or equivalent
2 tablespoons dried parsley flakes
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3 cans (16 ounces each) Kuners Hot Chili Beans or equivalent.
Directions
Cook and drain the burger, then mix it all in a Crockpot, cook on medium for a few hours. You can cook longer if you like your vegetables softer. Usually after a couple of hours smelling it cooking, you canâ€™t pass up a bowl past three hours.
