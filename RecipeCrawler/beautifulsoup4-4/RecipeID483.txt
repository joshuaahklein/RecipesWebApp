Maple Pepper Bacon Strips:
8 slices thick cut bacon
½ cup honey
1 Tbsp grain Dijon mustard
1 tsp dry mustard
1 tsp black pepper
½ cup maple syrup
4 oz Samuel Adams Boston Lager
Corn Relish:
1½ cups cooked corn
¼ cup diced red bell pepper
¼ cup diced green bell pepper
1 small white onion, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
¼ cup white vinegar
½ tsp celery seed
½ tsp mustard seed
2 Tbsp sugar
kosher salt
Directions
Maple Pepper Bacon Strips:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Lay bacon on sheet pan on parchment paper. Cover with one more sheet of parchment paper. Bake at 300 degrees for 14 to 15 minutes. Bring honey and maple syrup mixture to a boil in a saucepan. Caramelize. Add beer and reduce by half. Then add mustard. Take top sheet of parchment paper off bacon. Baste with honey mixture. Return bacon to oven and turn temperature to 275 degrees until bacon is crispy.
Corn Relish:
In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the corn, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, onion, garlic, vinegar, celery seed, mustard seed, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil (the pan will contain only a small amount of liquid), then reduce heat to low and simmer 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Let the relish cool 1 hour before serving.
Cook burger to preferred temperature. Spread corn relish on top half of bun. Place burger on top of bottom bun and crisscross two bacon strips over the top. Top with top lettuce and tomato and bun and serve.
