Ingredients
8  cup apple cider or apple juice
2  tablespoons packed brown sugar
4  inches stick cinnamon
1  teaspoon whole allspice
1  teaspoon whole cloves
Peel from 1 lemon, cut into strips
2  tablespoons butter
Cinnamon sticks (optional)
Directions
1. Combine cider and brown sugar in a large saucepan. For a spice bag, tie cinnamon, allspice, cloves, and lemon peel in a 6-inch square of 100 percent cotton cheesecloth. Add spice bag to cider mixture. Bring to boiling over medium-high heat; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove and discard spice bag.
2. Top each serving with 1/2 teaspoon butter and serve with a cinnamon stick stirrer, if desired.
Make-Ahead Tip: After discarding spice bag, chill cider and reheat to serve. Or, keep prepared cider warm in a crockery cooker on low-heat setting.
