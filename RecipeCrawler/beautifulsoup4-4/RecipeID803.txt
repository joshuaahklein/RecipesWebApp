Ingredients
2 pork tenderloins, about 3/4 pound each
2/3 cup Kikkoman Roasted Garlic Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
Directions
Cut tenderloins diagonally into 1-1/2-inch thick slices; gently pound each slice to 1/2 inch thickness.
Combine roasted garlic teriyaki sauce, onion powder and white pepper; pour over pork in large plastic food storage bag. Press air out of bag; close top securely. Turn bag over several times to coat pork well. Refrigerate 45 minutes, turning bag over once.
Remove pork slices from marinade and place on grill 4 to 5 inches from hot coals. Cook 4 minutes on each side, or until pork is done. (Or, broil pork slices 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until pork is done.)
