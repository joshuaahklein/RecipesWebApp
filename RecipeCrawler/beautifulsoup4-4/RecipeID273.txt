Ingredients
1 3/4 cups flour
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla
3/4 cup butter, softened
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups peeled, finely chopped apples (2 to 3 apples)
1 cup chopped pecans
Caramel Frosting:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 to 4 cups powdered sugar, sifted
Directions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease the bottom only of 13-by-9-inch pan and set aside. In a bowl of an electric mixer, combine all ingredients except apples and pecans. Beat on medium speed until batter is smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in apples and pecans by hand. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean; or until cake springs back when lightly touched with fingertip. Cool completely on wire rack.
Caramel Frosting:
In large saucepan, melt butter and add brown sugar. Bring this mixture to a boil, stirring frequently. Boil and stir for 1 minute until thickened. Remove from heat and add milk. Beat with wire whisk until smooth. Add vanilla and beat again. Then add enough powdered sugar until of desired spreading consistency; the frosting should be pourable. Pour frosting over cake and spread to cover. Let cool and serve. Makes 2 cups.
