Ingredients
1 lb boneless beef chuck pot roast
2 1/2 cups baby carrots, cut in half - not lengthwise, do it the other way!
2 small Red or Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed not ground
1 bay leaf
2 14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes
1 cup water
1/2 cup frozen peas
Directions
Trim fat from meat and cut meat into 3/4&quot; pieces. In your crockpot, combine all ingredients EXCEPT for the frozen peas.  Stir well, then cover and cook on low-heat for 8-10 hours or high 4-5 hours.  About 5 minutes before serving, discard the bay leaf and stir in the frozen peas. Peas loose their color and texture if they are thrown in at the beginning of this recipe. Since they cook so quickly, it's best to toss them in at the end.  Makes a strong 4-5 servings.
