Ingredients
1  cup sliced leeks
1/2  cup chopped onion
1/4  cup margarine or butter
2  medium apples, peeled (if desired), cored, and chopped
1  cup chopped pecans
3/4  cup snipped dried apricots
1/2  teaspoon ground nutmeg
4  cups dry whole wheat or white bread cubes
1  tablespoon snipped fresh rosemary or 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1  tablespoon snipped fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
1  tablespoon snipped fresh parsley
1/2  to 3/4 cup half-and-half or light cream
1  egg, beaten
1  teaspoon salt
1/2  teaspoon pepper
Directions
1. In a large skillet cook the leeks and onion over medium heat in hot margarine or butter until tender but not brown. Stir in apples, pecans, apricots, and nutmeg. Cook and stir for 3 minutes more.
2. In a large bowl toss together bread cubes, rosemary, thyme, parsley, and cooked onion mixture. In a small bowl combine 1/2 cup of the half-and-half, the egg, salt, and pepper. Add to bread mixture and stir gently to coat. Add enough additional cream, if necessary, to make of desired consistency.
3. Use to stuff an 8- to 10-pound turkey. Or, place in a greased 1 1/2-quart casserole. Bake, covered, in a 325 degree F oven for 25 minutes or in a 375 degree F oven for 20 minutes. Uncover and bake an additional 10 to 15 minutes or until heated through. (Internal temperature should register 165 degree F with an instant-read thermometer.) Makes 8 to 10 servings.
