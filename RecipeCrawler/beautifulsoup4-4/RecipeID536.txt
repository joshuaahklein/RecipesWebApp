Pasta and Veggies
Rating:
1
Ingredients
1 box of  Penne
2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil
1 bag of frozen broccoli (or cauliflower)
salt
pepper
garlic powder
Directions
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add a tad of extra virgin olive oil and then add the bag of frozen veggies. Cook to desired tenderness. The brighter green the veggies, the more nutrients that remain.
A great alternative to boiling the veggies is to steam them. It holds more of the nutrients. If you have a rice cooker with a steam basket, or a steamer, use it.
Bring water to a boil. Add a touch of olive oil to the water and then add pasta once it’s boiling. Cook your pasta to it’s desired tenderness. Being Italian, we like it al dente (to the teeth), not mushy.
After both pasta and veggies are cooked, toss together in a big bowl. Add the 2 tbsp of olive oil, a dash of salt, crushed black pepper, and garlic powder (or minced garlic if you like that better).
Alternatives: you can toss in cauliflower instead, toss in toasted multi-grain bread cubes for some crunch, or toss in some boiled shrimp for added protein!
