Ingredients
4 boneless pork loin chops - 1/2&quot; thick, 5 oz each
2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage
freshly ground salt & pepper
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 Granny Smith apples, diced into 1/2&quot; pieces
1 medium onion, cut into 1/2&quot; wedges
Directions
Rub both sides of the pork chops with the sage. Salt & pepper each side too.  Heat a skillet with half the extra virgin olive oil and when hot, sear the pork chops until golden on both sides, about 6 minutes total. Transfer to a plate. Add the rest of the extra virgin olive oil, the apples, and onion to the skillet and cook over medium-high heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Return the chops to the skillet. Cover and cook, turning once, until cooked through.
