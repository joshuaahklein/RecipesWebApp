Ingredients
1 pre-rolled short crust pastry sheet
1/2 each, large red and green pepper, diced
1/2 onion, chopped
2 large garlic cloves, chopped
2 tbsp olive oil
1 round zucchini, halved and thinly sliced
2 tomatoes, seeded, halved and sliced
3 eggs, beaten
7-8 ounces Bayonne ham, chopped
7-8 ounces goat cheese, crumbled
2 tbsp fresh chives, chopped
1/2 tsp piment d’espelette
Directions
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.   Place the pastry in a pie plate with parchment paper. Stab a few holes in the pastry with a fork and refrigerate until ready to use.
Saute the peppers, onions and garlic in the olive oil until the peppers are crisp tender.   Add the tomatoes and zucchini, then continue to cook until the zucchini is just wilted. Drain and set aside to cool.
Mix the eggs, cheese, piment, ham, and chives together, then add to the cooled vegetables. Pour this mixture into the pastry lined plate and bake for 40-45 minutes. Allow to cool, then remove the finished tart from the pan with the help of the parchment paper.
