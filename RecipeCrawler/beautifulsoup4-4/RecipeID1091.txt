Three Bean Casserole
Rating:
3
Ingredients
1 pound beef frankfurters, sliced
1 (15 ounce) can pork and beans
1 (15 ounce) can butter beans
1 (16 ounce) can chili beans, drained
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
Directions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl combine the frankfurters, pork and beans, butter beans, chili beans, onion, sugar, oregano and vinegar. Mix all together and pour mixture into a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish. (I just mix everything right in the casserole dish to save on clean up.) Bake uncovered at 350 degrees F for 1 hour, or until cooked through and bubbly (I usually take it out after about 40-45 minutes).
