Ingredients
1-1/2  cups sliced celery
3/4  cup chopped onion
1/3  cup butter or margarine
1-1/2  teaspoons dried sage, crushed
3/4  teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
1/2  teaspoon pepper
9  cups dry bread cubes
3/4  cup chopped pecans or hazelnuts
3/4  cup dried cranberries
3/4  to 1 cup chicken broth or water
Directions
1. In a small saucepan, cook and stir celery and onion in hot butter about 5 minutes or until tender. Remove from heat. Stir in sage, thyme, and pepper.
2. Place bread cubes in a large bowl. Add celery mixture, pecans, and cranberries. Drizzle with enough of the chicken broth (about 3/4 cup) to moisten, tossing gently.
3. Use to stuff a 16-pound turkey. (Or place stuffing in a greased 3-quart casserole. If you want a moist stuffing, drizzle with remaining chicken broth. Cover and bake in a 325 degree F oven about 45 minutes or until heated through.)
