Ingredients
1 (14 ounce) package won ton wrappers
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon finely grated ginger
1/2 teaspoon minced cilantro
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
3 tablespoons dark soy sauce
1 (16 ounce) package crab meat (fresh frozen or canned), finely chopped
1/2 cup vegetable oil
Directions
In a small bowl, mix together cream cheese, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, parsley, cilantro and crab meat. Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture into the center of each wanton wrapper. Fold the won ton wrapper over the stuffing to make a triangle or a half moon, depending on the shape of the won ton wrappers you have purchased. Moisten the edges with a little water, and seal. Place prepared won tons under a slightly moist paper towel until ready for frying. Fill fryer at least 4 inches deep with oil, and heat to 360 degrees F. Add 3 or 4 wantons to the hot oil, and cook until golden brown, turning once. Set aside on paper towels to drain. Repeat until all wantons have been fried. Serve hot.
