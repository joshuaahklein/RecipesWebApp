2 pounds lean ground beef
2 medium onions, chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
1/3 cup Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce
1 can (28 oz.) crushed tomatoes in puree
1 can (16 oz.) red kidney beans, drained & rinsed
1 can (6 oz.) tomato paste
1 can (6 oz.) chopped green chiles
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
Directions
In a large saucepan over medium high heat, brown beef for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain fat and add onion, pepper and garlic. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in Worcestershire Sauce, tomatoes, beans, paste, chilies, chili powder, cumin and salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Here's a tip: For a spicier version, add one fresh jalapeno, chopped, and saut√© with the onions and pepper.
