Rating:
5
Ingredients
1/2 cup plain yogurt
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
3 teaspoons fresh lime juice, divided
3 teaspoons olive oil, divided
1 teaspoon minced peeled fresh ginger
1 garlic clove, pressed
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
1 teaspoon coriander seeds
4 6-ounce salmon fillets with skin
Lime wedges
Directions
Mix yogurt, cilantro, 1 teaspoon lime juice, 1 teaspoon oil, ginger, and garlic in small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Place fennel seeds and coriander seeds in heavy-duty plastic bag. Using a mallet, crush seeds. Sprinkle flesh of the fillets with salt, pepper, and seeds.
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add fillets, seed (flesh) side down. Cook until brown, about 3 minutes. Turn over. Cook until just opaque in center, about 3 minutes (the skin should be nice and crispy by this point). Drizzle with 2 teaspoons lime juice. Place fillets on plates. Top with sauce; serve with lime wedges.
