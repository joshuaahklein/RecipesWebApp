Ingredients
2  cups granulated sugar
2  cups water
1/4  cup margarine or butter
1/4  teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4  teaspoon ground nutmeg
2  cups all-purpose flour
2  teaspoons baking powder
1/2  teaspoon salt
3/4  cup shortening
2/3  cup milk
1/4  cup granulated sugar
1/2  teaspoon ground cinnamon
3  cups shredded, peeled cooking apples (3 to 4 medium), such as Golden Delicious, Rome, Granny Smith, Jonathan, or Newton Pippin
Directions
1. For sauce, in a large saucepan, combine 2 cups sugar, the water, margarine, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg. Bring to boiling and boil for 5 minutes; set aside (should have about 2 cups sauce).
2. For dough, in a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut in shortening until pea-size. Make well in center. Add milk all at once. Stir just until moistened. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface 10 to 12 strokes or until nearly smooth. Roll out to 12x10-inch rectangle.
3. For filling, combine 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon; set aside. Sprinkle apples evenly over dough. Sprinkle with sugar mixture. Roll dough into spiral, starting from a long side. Pinch seam to seal. Cut into twelve 1-inch-thick pieces. Place in 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Pour sauce over dumplings. Bake in a 350 degree F oven about 50 minutes or until golden.
