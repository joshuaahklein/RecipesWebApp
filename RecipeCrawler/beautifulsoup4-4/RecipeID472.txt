For the bean mixture, cook the bacon in a saucepot for about 5 minutes over medium heat, until the bacon fat starts releasing. Add the onions and sweat for 2 minutes. Add the black beans and cover with water. Cook until the beans are soft, refilling with water when necessary.
In a hot saute pan, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and sear the shrimp on both sides until they are cooked through, about 3 minutes on both sides. Remove the oil from the pan. Add in the BBQ sauce to coat the shrimp.
