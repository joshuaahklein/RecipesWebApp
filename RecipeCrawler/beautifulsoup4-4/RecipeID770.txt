Ingredients
3 pounds lamb breast riblets, cut into serving-size pieces
1/3 cup Kikkoman Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce
Directions
Place riblets in large saucepan. Add enough water to cover and bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, 20 minutes.
Drain; pat riblets dry with paper towels to remove excess water.
Place riblets on grill about 4 to 5 inches from hot coals. Brush thoroughly with teriyaki marinade & sauce. Cook about 8 minutes, turning over frequently and basting often with teriyaki sauce. (Or, broil riblets 4 inches from heat source 4 minutes on each side, brushing frequently with teriyaki sauce.)
