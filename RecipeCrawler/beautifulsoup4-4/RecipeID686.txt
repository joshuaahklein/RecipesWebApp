Ingredients
5-6 Potatoes
Butter
Milk
Directions
Peel and cut up Potatoes.
Boil Until Tender
Mash and add butter then add milk while stirring until about consistency of Cream of Mushroom or Cream of Chicken soup or a little thinner.
Add Salt and Pepper to taste.
Note as cools will get thicker, and when completely cold will almost revert back to Creamed Potato State.
Need to stir again when reheating to get back to soup state.
You can add chopped onions if you desire.
