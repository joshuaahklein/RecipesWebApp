Ingredients
2 1/2 lbs ground beef
1 pkg cream cheese & chives
1 box jumbo pasta shells
1/2 pkg regular cream cheese
2 jars taco sauce
2 cups crushed tortilla chips
1 teaspoon each salt & chili powder
2 tablespoons butter, melted
3 cups shredded mixed cheese
Garnishes could include: diced tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, etc.
Directions
Cook pasta shells according to package.  Meanwhile, cook beef in large skillet over medium-high heat until brown, stirring to separate meat; drain fat. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add cream cheese, salt and chili powder; simmer 5 minutes. Toss shells with butter (so they don't stick to one another) and let cool about 5 minutes so that you can handle them. Fill shells with beef mixture and arrange in a buttered 13x9 inch pan. This is the part where it really helps to have the extra set of hands - it just makes it go quicker plus it's more fun to have help! Pour taco sauce over each shell - be liberal! Cover with foil and bake in a 350 oven for 15 minutes. Uncover, top with cheese and chips and bake an additional 15 more minutes or until bubbly. Serve alongside whatever toppings you wish: tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, etc.  We usually serve this with chips & our favorite salsa.  Each person usually eats 4 shells which means this dish makes a solid 7 servings
