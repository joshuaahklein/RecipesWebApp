Ingredients
1 1/4 cups light cream
2 small jalapenos, seeds removed & diced
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 boneless skinless chicken breast, halved
1/4 cup Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce
1 lemon, juice and zest
Directions
In a blender or food processor, purée cream and jalapeno, and set aside.
In a large skillet, generously sprayed with nonstick cooking spray then placed over medium-high heat, briefly sauté garlic and add chicken. Sauté for 4 to 6 minutes on each side, or until browned and cooked through. Deglaze pan with Worcestershire Sauce. Stir in cream mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes or until sauce has thickened.
Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. To serve, slice chicken, top with sauce and garnish with lemon zest.
Here's a tip: If sauce becomes too thick, add additional Tbsp. of cream and tsp. of Worcestershire Sauce.
