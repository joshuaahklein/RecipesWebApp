Ingredients
1-2 cups mashed potatoes
1 egg
Garlic salt, salt, and pepper
Olive oil
Directions
In a bowl, mix together the mashed potatoes and egg thoroughly.  Make 3&quot; patties with the mixture and have a thickness of about 1/4&quot; - 1/3&quot;.  On one side, salt and pepper the patties. Flip them over and lightly sprinkle garlic salt and pepper.  Heat up olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.  When the pan is hot, place the patties over the olive oil - that's what makes it brown so nice.  Wait 8 minutes before flipping them. It will feel like a really long 8 minutes the first time ) but if you flip them too early, they will fall apart.  Wait another 6-8 minutes for the other side to become golden brown.
Note: For an extra twist, add some fresh chopped parsley to the mixture before making the patties. It'll brighten the flavor and your plate.
