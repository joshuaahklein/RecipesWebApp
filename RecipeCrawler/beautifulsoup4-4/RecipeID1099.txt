Fiery BBQ Pork Tenderloin
Rating:
3
Ingredients
2/3 cup bourbon
2/3 cup water
2 tbsp sherry vinegar
2 tbsp minced fresh ginger
1 jalapeno pepper, blistered in a hot skillet or on a grill, and minced (you want a pretty spicy jalapeno for this recipe - alternatively use a serrano or use a seeded habanero)
2 tsp minced garlic
2 1 1/4 lb pork tenderloins (if you have smaller tenderloins you can make less marinade accordingly)
1/2 cup molasses
1/2 cup ketchup
1 tsp kosher salt, plus more to taste
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
1 tbsp vegetable or canola oil, plus more for brushing
Directions
In a shallow bowl, combine the bourbon, water, vinegar, ginger, chile, and garlic. Add the pork tenderloins and turn to coat. Marinate at room temperature for 1 hour, turning every 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
Remove the pork from the marinade; brush off any excess and pat dry. In a small saucepan, boil the marinade over high heat until reduced by one third, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the sorghum molasses and ketchup and cook over medium heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet. Brush the tenderloins lightly with oil and season them with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Sear the pork over high heat, turning occasionally, until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour the barbecue sauce over the pork and transfer the skillet to the oven. Roast for about 12-14 minutes, or until cooked through, turning the meat in the sauce. Transfer the pork to a work surface, cover with aluminum foil, and let stand for at least 5 minutes.
To serve, thickly slice the meat across the grain and serve with any remaining sauce.
