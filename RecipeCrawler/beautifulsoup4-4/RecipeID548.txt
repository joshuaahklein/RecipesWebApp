Winter Hearty Chili

Ingredients
1 lb lean ground beef
Small handful of diced onion
1 15 oz can corn
1 15 oz can light or dark kidney beans
1 28 oz can diced tomatoes
2 8 oz cans of tomato sauce
1 green pepper diced
1 package of McCormick's Original Chili Seasoning packet
Directions
Brown the ground beef with the diced onion in a skillet. While that is cooking, pour all the canned items, green pepper, and seasoning packet together in either a crockpot or large soup pot. While some recipes tell you to drain the cans first, DON'T! By doing so, you are letting the yummy juices escape. Pour it all in and not only are you getting more flavor, you are 'stretching' the chili. Once the beef is done, drain and add it to the crockpot/pot.  I would suggest making this in the crockpot and stirring it a few times on low over the course of 2-3 hours.
