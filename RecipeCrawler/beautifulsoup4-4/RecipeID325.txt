Ingredients
2  cups chopped, peeled, raw sweet potatoes
1  cup chopped onion
1  cup sliced celery
1  tablespoon snipped fresh cilantro
1  teaspoon ground ginger
5  cups coarsely crumbled corn bread
3/4  cup chopped walnuts
2 to 4  tablespoons chicken broth
1/4  cup margarine or butter
Directions
1. In a large skillet cook sweet potatoes, onion, and celery in hot margarine or butter for 5 to 7 minutes or until just tender. Spoon mixture into a large mixing bowl. Stir in cilantro and ginger. Add cornbread and walnuts; toss gently to coat. Add enough chicken broth to moisten.
2. Use to stuff one 8- to 10-pound bird or place stuffing in a 1-1/2 to 2 quart casserole. Bake casserole, covered, in a 375 degree F. oven about 45 minutes or until heated through. Makes about 6 cups stuffing (10 servings).
Make-Ahead Tip: Prepare stuffing; cover and chill up to 24 hours. Do not use to stuff bird. Bake in casserole as directed.
