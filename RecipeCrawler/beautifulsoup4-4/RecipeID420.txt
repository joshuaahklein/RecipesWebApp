4  cloves garlic, minced
2  tablespoons olive oil or cooking oil
2  tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2  to 1 teaspoon black pepper
1-1/4  cups milk
1  10-ounce package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and thoroughly drained
1  10-ounce package frozen chopped broccoli, thawed and thoroughly drained

Directions
1. Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain; set aside.
2. In a medium bowl combine eggs, cottage cheese, ricotta cheese, and Italian seasoning. Set aside.
3. In a large skillet cook mushrooms, onion, and garlic in hot oil until tender. Stir in the flour and pepper; add milk all at once. Cook and stir until slightly thickened and bubbly. Remove from heat. Stir in the spinach, broccoli, carrot, and 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese.
4. To assemble, in a greased 3-quart rectangular baking dish, layer one-third of the noodles, folding or cutting to fit, if necessary. Spread with one-third of the cottage cheese mixture, then one-third of the vegetable mixture. Sprinkle with one-third of the mozzarella. Repeat the layers twice. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
5. Bake, uncovered, in a 350 degree F oven for 35 minutes or until heated through. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
