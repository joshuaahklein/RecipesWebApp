Ingredients
1 1/2 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup EACH vegetable oil and milk
3/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 egg
1 cup fresh blueberries
Crumb Topping:
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup (half stick) butter, cubed
1/3 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
Directions
Preheat oven to 400. Grease muffin cups or line with muffin liners.
For muffins:  Combine flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. Place vegetable oil into a 1 cup measuring cup; add the egg and enough milk to fill the cup. Mix this with flour mixture. Foil in blueberries. Fill muffin cups to nearly the top and sprinkle with the crumb topping.
To make crumb topping:  Mix together sugar, flour, butter and cinnamon with a fork until it is coarse. Sprinkle over muffins before baking. Leftover crumb topping is great on pancakes!
Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.  Cool on a rack and enjoy!  Makes about 8 or 9 muffins.
