A popular and classic Mexican beverage.
Ingredients
2 cups long-grain white rice
1 cup almonds, skins on, lightly toasted
2 cinnamon sticks, Mexican variety
2 vanilla pods, seeded or 1/2 tablespoon vanilla paste
2 1/2 cups sugar (or to taste)
1 gallon, plus 1 quart water
Directions
Combine rice, almonds and cinnamon in a 4 quart container. Bring 2 quarts of water up to a simmer. Pour water over the rice mixture, and let steep for 6 hours.
In a blender, pulse rice mixture on the highest setting until smooth.
Strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer, over a large container, pour remaining water over the rice pulp to extract any remaining starch. Use the back of a spoon to push any remaining water through.
Add in vanilla and sugar, adjusting sweetness to your liking.
Stir the horchata well before serving. Pour into ice-filled glasses, and garnish with a dusting of ground cinnamon.
