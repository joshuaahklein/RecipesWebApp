A basic, traditional beer bread.
Ingredients
3 cups flour (sifted)
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
1 (12 ounce) cans beer
1/2 cup melted butter
Directions
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Mix dry ingredients and beer.  Pour into a greased loaf pan.  Pour melted butter over mixture.
Bake 1 hour, remove from pan and cool for at least 15 minutes.
NOTES: This recipe makes a very hearty bread with a crunchy, buttery crust. If you prefer a softer crust (like a traditional bread) mix the butter into the batter instead of pouring it over the top.
