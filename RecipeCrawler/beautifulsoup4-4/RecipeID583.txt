Ingredients
1 lb ground sausage
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped carrot
1 cup chopped celery
8 cups chicken broth
1 14.5oz can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, & oregano
1 8oz can tomato sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning
1 bay leaf
1 cup dried orzo pasta or any little pasta
Directions
This recipe calls for a dutch oven; however, if you do not have one, I'd venture to say that you can use a large stockpot but you may want to check it more frequently to stir and make sure ingredients do not stick to the bottom.
In your dutch oven/pot, cook sausage, onion, carrot, and celery over medium heat until sausage is brown. Break up the sausage while cooking so that you have nice bite size pieces instead of a big lump.  Drain well.
Add all other ingredients EXCEPT pasta.  Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 1 hour. Simmer does not mean that it is boiling - you need to really take it down low. This is the part where those flavors will just meld together and make something unimaginable.  After the hour, add uncooked pasta. Return to a boil and reduce heat. Cook uncovered for an additional 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf before serving.
