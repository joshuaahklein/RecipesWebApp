Ingredients
1-1/2  pounds green beans, washed and both ends trimmed
3  Tbsp. unsalted butter
2  tsp. fresh garlic, finely chopped with pinch of salt
2  Tbsp. chopped parsley
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
Flat-leaf parsley (optional)
Directions
1. Fill large pot with water; bring to rolling boil. Add 1 tablespoon salt and the beans. Cook, uncovered, for 5 to 8 minutes or until tender but still vibrant green and slightly resistant to the bite. Drain beans; immediately submerge in bowl of lightly salted ice water to stop cooking and set color. When thoroughly chilled, drain well. (Beans can be prepared to this point 1 day ahead and refrigerated.)
2. In a wide skillet heat butter over medium-high heat until hot and foaming. Add beans. Cook, tossing often, until heated through. Sprinkle with garlic and parsley, a generous amount of salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Cook 1 minute longer, tossing frequently to distribute flavorings and avoid burning the garlic. Sprinkle with additional parsley. Serve immediately.
