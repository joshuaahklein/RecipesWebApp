Chili-Rubbed Salmon with Pineapple-Peach Salsa
Rating:
4
Ingredients
1/2 cup pineapple, chopped
1 peach, diced
1/4 cup red onion, diced
2 Tablespoons parsley, chopped
4 4oz. salmon fillets (or like I said, two massive ones)
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon chili powder
salt for seasoning
Directions
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a small bowl, make salsa by combining pineapple, peach, red onion and parsley. Mix until combined and set aside.
Place salmon fillets on a counter/cutting board and season the top side with salt. In another small bowl, combine cayenne and chili powder. Sprinkle the powder generously over the top of each fillet and rub in with your fingers until it's well coated. Place fillets on a nonstick pan coated with cooking spray so that the skin does not stick.
