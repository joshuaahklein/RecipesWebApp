Ingredients
1 lb straw or oyster mushrooms (if oyster, chop coarsely)
1 piece kombu
1 oz dulse
4 cups vegetable stock
2 tbs olive oil
3 medium yellow onions, peeled and diced
3 tbs flour
2 pounds red potatoes, peeled and cut into ¾ in cubes
3 cups milk
¾ cup heavy cream
3 tbs butter
Salt and freshly ground white pepper
Directions
Toss shitakes in olive oil and salt liberally. Place on half sheet tray and cook in convection oven on 350 until crisp. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Reserve for garnish.
In medium pot, add mushrooms, kombu, dulse, and vegetable stock. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover. Allow to simmer for 30 minutes. Remove mushrooms from stock and chop coarsely. Set aside.
In another medium pot, heat oil. Add onions and sweat. Add flour to onions, stir for 1 minute. Add potatoes, vegetable stock, and enough water to cover potatoes. Increase heat to boil, then lower to a simmer and cook, covered until potatoes are tender, but still holding together.
Add mushrooms, milk, and cream to pot. Simmer until heated through. Do not boil. Stir in butter and season to taste with salt and white pepper.
Serve in bowls with fresh parsley to garnish and shitake mushrooms.
