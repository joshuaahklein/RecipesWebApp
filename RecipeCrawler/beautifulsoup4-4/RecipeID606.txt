Ingredients
Salad:
4 firm Rome apples (alternate Empire, Jonagold, Fuji, Braeburn, Jonamac, or McIntosh)
2 Tbsp. brown sugar
8 cups mixed greens
4 Tbsp. thinly sliced green onion
2 slices cooked and crumbled bacon
1/2 cup crumbed feta cheese
Dressing:
2 tsp. whole grain mustard
1 Tbsp. honey
1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
2 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
Directions
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Spray a large baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray.  In a large bowl, toss apples with brown sugar.  Spread in a single layer on prepared sheet.  Bake for 15-20 minutes until apples begin to brown but are still firm enough to pick up with a form.  Remove and cool.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, toss greens and green onions together.  Chill for 30 minutes.  Shake dressing ingredients together in a small jar.  Set aside.  Just before serving, drizzle salad with dressing.  Toss.  Divide into four salad bowls.  Divide bacon and cheese onto each.  Arrange 6 apple slices on each.  Serve immediately.
