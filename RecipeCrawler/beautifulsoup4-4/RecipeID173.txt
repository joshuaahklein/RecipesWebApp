Ingredients
2 Tablespoons Butter
2 Medium-large Zucchini, Sliced (do not skin)
1-2 Medium-large Yellow Squash (do not skin)
1-small yellow onion
1-2 Cans Sweet Corn, drained, reserve liquid
4-6 oz Velveeta (Kraft Sharp if you prefer some zip)
Directions
Melt butter in a large skillet. Sauté’ squash and onion in butter and about half of the liquid from one can of corn.  Cook squash until clear (we prefer it a little firm so I don’t cook it quit until clear).  When the squash is done, cut up the cheese and melt it in the squash.  Add the corn, salt and pepper.  Heat thoroughly, let stand about 5 minutes and serve or if you need a casserole this can be fixed ahead of time and refrigerated –put squash mixture in an ungreased 9 x 13 dish, layer cheese over the top and warm in oven until the cheese melts.
