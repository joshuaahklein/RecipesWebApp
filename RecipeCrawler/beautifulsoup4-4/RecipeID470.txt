4 Tablespoons olive oil
Zest of 1 lemon
2 Tablespoons ground cumin
2 Cloves garlic, minced
2 Teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1/2 Cup of Samuel Adams Summer Ale
Six 8-10 ounce swordfish steaks
AVOCADO BUTTER INGREDIENTS:
2 Ripe avocados- skins removed and pitted
2 Tablespoons salted butter
2 Teaspoons ground cumin
2 Teaspoons ground coriander
Sprigs of fresh coriander to garnish
2 Teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
Directions
Combine olive oil, zest, cumin, garlic, pepper and Samuel Adams Summer Ale. Generously coat swordfish and let marinate 1 hour (up to 6).
Preheat grill to medium heat. Remove excess marinade from swordfish. Place swordfish on grill and cook 3-5 minutes on each side until fish becomes opaque, but not dry.
Dollop fish with 2 tablespoons (or more if you desire) of avocado butter, and let it melt onto and into the fish. Serve immediately.
In a blender, puree avocados and butter. Add cumin, coriander, salt and pepper.
