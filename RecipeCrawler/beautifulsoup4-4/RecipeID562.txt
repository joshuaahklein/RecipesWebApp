5
Ingredients
1/2 cup rolled oats
3/4 cup flour
1/2 cup light brown sugar
pinch of salt
7 tablespoons softened butter, diced
3/4 cup walnuts
2 1/2 lbs baking applies, cut into 3/4&quot; chunks
2 cups raspberries
3 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons flour
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
Directions
Preheat the oven to 375&quot; and butter a 2-quart shallow baking dish.  In one bowl, mix the first 6 ingredients with your fingers until evenly moistened; set aside. In a second bowl, mix the last 6 ingredients. Pour the apple-raspberry mixture into your prepared baking dish. Then, squeeze handfuls of the crumble mixture (almost like little balls) and scatter on top of the fruit. Bake uncovered for 40-45 minutes or until golden and bubbly. Let it stand 10 minutes before serving.  Add some ice cream or cool whip on top and you have a winner!
