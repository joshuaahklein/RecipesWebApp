This recipe also calls for 1 tsp. of turmeric and 1tsp of ginger. But Mother doesn’t use them, she doesn’t like the taste ginger and turmeric turns everything yellow, doesn’t look appetizing
How you slice pickle depends upon size of the cucumbers. If they are little small midget size they can be whole. If normal eating size slice in chip format (looks like quarter, or a 50 cent piece), if a little large slice in half lengthwise, then in half again (4 lengthwise pieces).
