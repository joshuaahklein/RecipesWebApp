Ingredients
3/4 cup sugar, plus extra for dusting
1 cup softened, unsalted butter
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1 tsp. vanilla
1 egg yolk
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 tsp. salt
Directions
Beat together the sugar and butter with an electric beater on high speed for about 3 minutes.  Add maple syrup, vanilla, and egg, and mix for 1 minute.  Sift flour and salt into the butter mixture.  Beat at medium speed for 2 minutes.  Shape the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate overnight.
The next day, divide the dough into two equal portions.  Working with one portion at a time, roll out a lightly floured surface to about 1/8-inch thick.  Cut out shapes with a cookie cutter and place on greased cookie sheets about 1-inch apart.  Gather scraps, reroll, and cut out as many additional cookies as possible.  Repeat with second dough portion.  Dust the cookies with granulated sugar.  Bake at 350-degrees for 9-12 minutes, until lightly golden brown.
