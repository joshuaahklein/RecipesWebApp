Ingredients
1  cup whole bran cereal
1  cup fat-free milk
1/4  cup sugar
1  slightly beaten egg
1/4  cup cooking oil
1/2  teaspoon finely shredded lemon peel
1  cup all-purpose flour
1/2  cup whole wheat flour
2  teaspoons baking powder
1/4  teaspoon salt
Nonstick cooking spray
3/4  cup raspberries or blueberries (optional)
Directions
In a medium mixing bowl combine cereal and milk. Let stand 3 minutes. Stir in sugar, egg, oil, and lemon peel. In a large bowl stir together flours, baking powder, and salt. Add cereal mixture to dry ingredients and stir just until moistened. Stir in berries, if desired.
Lightly coat 12 muffin pan cups with nonstick cooking spray. Fill each cup about two-thirds full with batter. Bake in a 400 degree F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Makes 12 servings (12 muffins).
Make-Ahead Tip: If not using raspberries, the batter may be made up to 3 days before baking.
