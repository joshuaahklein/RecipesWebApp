While meat is on grill, place thoroughly washed Swiss chard in boiling salt water and allow to simmer for 5 to 6 minutes. Drain chard thoroughly and arrange a bed of chard on each serving plate and top with 3 slices of pork arranged on top of each other on angles. Top with generous serving of Signature Sauce.
