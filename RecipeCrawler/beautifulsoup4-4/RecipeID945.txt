Italian Wedding Soup
Rating:
5
Ingredients
1 lb 1-inch turkey meatballs (we got ours from the farmers' market but you can make them yourself with whatever combination of grated cheese, bread crumbs, garlic and herbs you want)
3 tbsp evoo, divided
1 medium yellow onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
6 cups chicken stock
1 bunch escarole, trimmed and torn into bite-sized pieces (about 6 lightly packed cups)
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, finely grated
s&p
Directions
In large nonstick skillet, heat 2 tbsp evoo over moderately high heat.  Add the meatballs in batches, and cook, turning, until browned on the outside all over, 3 to 5 minutes.  You don't need to cook them all the way through because they will cook more in the soup.  Remove meatballs from the pan and set aside.
In a large heavy soup pot, heat the remaining 1 tbsp evoo over moderate heat.  Add the onion saute, stirring occasionally for 3 minutes.  Add garlic and saute until onions are tender and garlic is soft, but not browned, about 2 additional minutes.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Add the escarole and the orzo, reduce heat to simmer for 6 minutes.  Add the meatballs and cook another 4 minutes.
Slow pour the lightly beaten egg into hot soup, stirring constantly.  Stir in Parm-Reg.  Simmer just until egg bits are set, about 1-2 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
Serve with bread and additional Parm-Reg for garnish.
