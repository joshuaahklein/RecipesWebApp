Ingredients
1 1/3 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 tablespoons margarine
1 1/2 tablespoon white sugar
3/4 teaspoons salt
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
4 cups water
1 1/2 tablespoons baking soda
2 tablespoons kosher salt
Directions
In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water.  Proof for 5 minutes.  Mix in butter or margarine, flour and salt.  Cut dough into short strips, roll into ropes, and shape into pretzels.  Cover, and let rise on a greased baking sheet for about 45 minutes.  In a cast iron or other nonaluminium pan, bring water and baking soda almost to a boil. Gently lower pretzels into water of about 1 minute, turning once.  Do not let water come to a full boil.  Remove pretzels, and return to greased baking sheet.  Sprinkle with kosher salt.  Bake at 475 degrees for about 12 minutes.
