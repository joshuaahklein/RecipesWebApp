Ingredients
Frozen puff pastry - thaw it before you are ready to cook
1/3 lb sliced deli turkey
1/3 cup apricot preserves
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
Directions
Spray a cookie sheet with PAM.  Roll the puff pastry out onto a clean surface. Evenly spread the apricot preserves onto the two puff pastry sheets (you can just use one sheet and half the recipe if you wish).  Next layer the turkey and top with the shredded mozzarella. Carefully roll the puff pastry sheet into a log. Cut the log into about 1/4&quot; slices; you should be able to get about 16 slices out. Spread the pinwheels out onto the cookie sheet and bake for 15 minutes at 400 degrees or until golden brown.
