Ingredients
Turkey giblets
1  cup finely chopped celery (2 stalks)
1/2  cup chopped onion (1 medium)
1/2  cup butter or margarine
1  tablespoon snipped fresh sage or 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning or ground sage
1/4  teaspoon black pepper
1/8  teaspoon salt
8  cups dry bread cubes (see tip)
1  to 1-1/3 cups chicken broth or water
Directions
1. Rinse giblets. Refrigerate liver until needed. In a small saucepan cook the remaining giblets, covered, in enough boiling water to cover for 1 hour. Add liver. Simmer, covered, for 20 to 30 minutes more or until tender. Drain* and chop giblets; set aside.
2. In the same saucepan cook celery and onion in hot butter over medium heat until tender but not brown; remove from heat. Stir in giblets, sage, pepper, and salt. Place dry bread cubes in a very large bowl; add the onion mixture. Drizzle with enough broth to moisten, tossing lightly to combine.
3. Use bread mixture to stuff one 8- to 10-pound turkey. (See stuffing tips and roasting chart for doneness temperatures and roasting times.) Place any remaining stuffing in a 1-quart casserole. (If necessary, to moisten, add more broth to stuffing in casserole.) Cover and chill until ready to bake.
4. Bake stuffing in casserole alongside turkey during the last 35 to 40 minutes of roasting time or until heated through. Or place all of stuffing in a 2-quart casserole. Bake, covered, in a 325 degree F oven for 35 to 40 minutes or until heated through. Makes 10 to 12 servings.
5. *Note: If desired, substitute 1 to 1-1/3 cups giblet-cooking broth for the chicken broth.
6. Oyster Stuffing: Prepare as above, except omit the giblets and use a medium saucepan. Add 1 pint shucked oysters, drained and chopped, to the cooked vegetables. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Stir in seasonings. Continue as above, except reduce broth to 1/4 cup.
7. Chestnut Stuffing: Prepare as above, except omit the giblets. With a knife, cut an X in the shells of 1 pound fresh chestnuts (3 cups). Spread chestnuts on a large baking sheet. Roast chestnuts in a 400 degree F oven for 15 minutes; cool. Peel and coarsely chop chestnuts. (Or, use one 8-ounce jar or one 10-ounce can whole, peeled chestnuts, drained and chopped.) Add chestnuts with seasonings. Use 3/4 cup to 1 cup broth.
