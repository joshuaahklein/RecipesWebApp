Divide pastry almost in half.  Roll out larger half on floured surface to 13&quot; circle.  Line 9&quot; pie plate with pastry.  Trim edge to 1/2&quot; beyond rim of pie plate.
Combine peaches, sugar, flour, lemon juice, cinnamon, salt and almond extract in bowl; mix well.  Arrange peach mixture in pastry-lined pie plate.  Dot, with butter.
Roll out remaining pastry to 11&quot; circle.  Cut slits.  Place top crust over filling and trim edge to 1&quot; beyond rim of pie plate.  Fold top crust under lower crust and form a ridge.  Flute the edge.
Bake in 400° oven for 40-45 minutes, or until peaches are tender.  Cool on rack.
