Ingredients
3 cups cornstarch
1 1/2 cups flour
2 teaspoons garlic salt
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
24 ounces beer
4 to 6 colossal onions, 4-inch diameter or larger
Seasoned Flour (recipe follows) *
Oil for deep-frying
Directions
Creamy Chili Sauce (recipe follows) **
To make batter, mix cornstarch, flour and seasonings until well blended. Add beer; mix well. Set aside. For each onion, cut about 3/4-inch off the top of the onion; peel onion. With cut side of the onion up, cut into the onion, top to bottom, to form 12 to 16 pie-shaped wedges, which will become the &quot;petals&quot; but do NOT cut through the bottom (root end) of the onion. Using a paring knife cut off the &quot;petals&quot; in the center of the onion (about a 1-inch diameter circle). Do not cut a hole through the onion. Dip cut onion into seasoned flour and remove excess by shaking. Stir beer batter, then dip floured onion into batter and remove excess by gently shaking. Holding onion upright, separate &quot;petals&quot; to coat thoroughly with batter. Heat oil in deep fat fryer or deep saucepan to 375 to 400 F. Your container should never be more than half full of oil. There should be enough oil to cover the onion and to allow the onion to move freely in the saucepan. Do not allow the fat to smoke. Gently place onion in the fryer basket or other wire-frying basket. Deep-fry for 1 1/2 minutes. Turn over and fry 1 to 1 1/2 minutes longer or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Place onion upright in shallow bowl and cut out root end with a circular cutter or apple corer. Serve hot with Creamy Chili Sauce. (You can place a small bowl of sauce in the center of the onion.)
* Seasoned Flour: Combine 2 cups flour, 4 teaspoons paprika, 2 teaspoons garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper; mix well.
** Creamy Chili Sauce: Combine 1 cup each mayonnaise and dairy sour cream, 1/4 cup chili sauce and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper; mix well.
