5
Ingredients
1 1/2 cups of flour
3 tablespoons sugar
3 eggs
2 cups milk
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
pinch of salt
1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract
butter, for coating the pan
Directions
In a blender, combine all of the ingredients and pulse for 10 seconds. Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour. This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking. The batter will keep for up to 48 hours.
Heat a small non-stick pan. Add butter to coat. Pour 1 ounce of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and remove a side. Lay them out flat so they can cool. Continue until all batter is gone.
Filling options:
Nutella chocolate
Strawberry with whip cream
Maple syrup
