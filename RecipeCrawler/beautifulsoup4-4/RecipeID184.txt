Ingredients
1 lb. dried Great Northern white beans, rinsed, picked over
1 can white corn
1 can garbonza beans
2 lbs. boneless chicken breast
1 tbsp. olive oil
2 med. onions, chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 (4 oz.) cans chopped mild green chilies
2 tsp. ground cumin
1 1/2 tsp. dried oregano, crumbled
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
6 c. chicken stock or canned broth
3 c. grated Monterey Jack cheese (about 12 oz.)

Directions
Place beans in heavy large pot. Add enough cold water to cover by at least 3 inches and soak overnight.
Place chicken in large heavy saucepan. Add cold water to cover and bring to simmer. Cook until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and cool. Remove skin. Cut chicken into cubes.
Drain beans. Heat oil in same pot over medium high heat. Add onions and saute until translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in garlic, then chilies, cumin, oregano, and cayenne and saute 2 minutes. Add beans and stock and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until beans are very tender, stirring occasionally about 2 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before continuing.)
Add chicken and 1 cup cheese to chili and stir until cheese melts. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle chili into bowls. Serve with remaining cheese, and sour cream.
