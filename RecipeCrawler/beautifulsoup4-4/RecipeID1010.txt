2 tablespoons granulated sugar
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 box Betty Crocker Gluten Free yellow cake mix
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup cooked and mashed sweet potatoes
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3 tablespoons plain yogurt
2 teaspoons gluten-free vanilla

Gluten-free powdered sugar, if desired
Directions
Heat oven to 350°F. Spray 12-cup fluted tube cake pan with cooking spray. In small bowl, mix pecans, granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon. Sprinkle into pan, turning pan to distribute evenly.
In large bowl, beat cake mix, brown sugar, 2 teaspoons of the cinnamon, nutmeg, sweet potatoes, oil, yogurt, vanilla and eggs with electric mixer on low speed 30 seconds, then on medium speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Carefully spoon into pan.
