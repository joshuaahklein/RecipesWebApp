Ingredients
3 ripe avocados
1/2 of a big sweet yellow onion
1/2 a box of grape tomatoes
1 bunch of cilantro
1 Serrano pepper (can use jalape√±o to make it less hot)
Lime juice
Directions
Dice up the avocado and onions.
Quarter the grape tomatoes.
Chop up the cilantro but be careful with it as it is tender.
Cut off the top of the pepper and remove the core with the seeds and the veins. This is the part of the pepper that makes it super hot.
Chop the remaining pepper.
Combine all the ingredients into a bowl and mix up.
Add lime juice to keep the avocados from browning.
