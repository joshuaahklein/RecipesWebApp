Ingredients
1/2 cup dried breadcrumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 Tbsp. finely chopped fresh parsley
1/2 tsp. pepper
1/4 tsp. salt
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 tsp. finely chopped fresh garlic
6 (4-ounces) boneless skinless chicken breasts
Directions
Heat oven to 375-degrees.  Combine breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, pepper, and salt in shallow bowl; set aside.
Combine butter and garlic in 9-inch pie pan.  Dip 1 chicken breast at a time into butter mixture.  Place into breadcrumb mixture, turning to coat evenly.  Place chicken breasts into ungreased 13-9-inch baking pan.  Drizzle with any remaining butter mixture.
Bake for 25 to 35 minutes or until chicken is lightly browned and juices run clear when pierced with a fork.
NOTE:  For added flavor add herbs to this recipe.  Try mixing 1/2 tsp. rosemary or sage into the melted butter mixture.
