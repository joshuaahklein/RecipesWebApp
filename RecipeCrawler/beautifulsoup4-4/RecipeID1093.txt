Ingredients
2 cups oats
1 cup flaxseed
1 cup sliced almonds
1 cup walnuts
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 tsp. salt
4 tbsp. applesauce
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup honey
1 tsp. vanilla
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup craisins
Directions
Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Line a 9x13” baking pan with foil and spray with non-stick cooking spray. Toast nuts and/or oatmeal in oven for 5 minutes if desired.
Mix oats, nuts, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl.
Combine applesauce, brown sugar, and honey in medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring until mixture begins to boil. Add vanilla and stir; remove from heat.
Pour over dry mixture, stirring until well-coated. Transfer to pan and, using a spatula, press oats evenly into pan.
Bake until top is golden brown (25-30 minutes), stirring every 10 minutes or so. Transfer pan to rack and cool for 30 minutes – 1 hour to make it crispy.
Using the foil as an aid, lift out of pan and crumble into pieces, mixing in craisins and/or raisins.
