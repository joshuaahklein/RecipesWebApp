1/4 cup lemon juice
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
Directions
In a medium bowl, mix together Worcestershire Sauce, lemon juice, sugar, mustard and pepper. Place chicken in marinade and turn until well-coated. Cover and marinate in refrigerator for one hour, or overnight if desired, turning occasionally.
Remove chicken from refrigerator, reserving marinade. Grill chicken over medium heat for 4 to 6 minutes on each side, or until cooked through, basting frequently for first 5 minutes. Discard any remaining marinade.
Here's a tip: For stovetop method, use large skillet sprayed with nonstick spray over medium-high heat. Cook chicken for 4 to 6 minutes on each side, or until cooked through, basting frequently for first 5 minutes. Discard any remaining marinade.
