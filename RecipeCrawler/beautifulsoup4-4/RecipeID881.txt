Ingredients
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs
3/4 cup Kikkoman Roasted Garlic & Herbs, Toasted Sesame,
Honey & Mustard or Gourmet Teriyaki Quick & Easy Marinade
1 red onion, peeled and chunked
6 (10-inch) metal or bamboo skewers*
Directions
Cut chicken into 2-inch square pieces.
Pour quick & easy marinade over chicken in large plastic food storage bag with onion. Press air out of bag; close top securely. Turn bag over several times to coat all pieces well. Marinate 20 minutes, turning bag over once.
Thread chicken and onion alternately onto skewers, leaving space between pieces.
Grill or broil 5 inches from heat source 7 minutes. Turn over; brush with fresh marinade. Cook 5 minutes longer, or until chicken is no longer pink in center.
*Soak bamboo skewers in water 30 minutes to prevent burning.
