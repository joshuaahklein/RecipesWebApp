Ingredients
3 zucchini
1 egg
3/4 cup chopped fresh spinach
3/4 cup bread crumbs
1/3 cup tomato sauce (used an open jar)
1/3 cup mozzarella cheese (or parmesan)
1/3 cup chopped onion
1 garlic clove, minced
Pinch of salt & pepper
1 diced tomato
Directions
Cut each zucchini in half and then cut it long ways. This will give you four pieces out of each zucchini.  Cut the insides out of the zucchini so that you have just the shell of the zucchini left. Dice up the zucchini guts that you just removed and mix it with all of the above ingredients in a bowl. Grab a zucchini shell and fill it with a heaping spoonful of the mixture.  Place in a greased 13x9‚Äù baking dish.  Once you have made all the zucchini boats, bake uncover for 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven. Feel free to broil for a few minutes at the end to brown them real nice.
