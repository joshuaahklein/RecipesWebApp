Ingredients
2 garlic cloves
2 thick slices of bread from a large rustic loaf, lightly toasted
5 tbsp evoo
1/3 lb shiitake mushrooms, stemmed, caps cut into 1/2-inch to 1-inch thick slices
s&p
1/3 lb oyster mushrooms, trimmed and left whole or cut in half if large
1/3 lb cremini mushrooms, stemmed, caps quartered
3 medium shallots, peeled and cut into thin rings
2 small heads of frisee, darker green outer leaves removed and yellow inner leaves torn
1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped
1/4 cup 1/2-inch batons of fresh chives
1 tbsp sherry vinegar
juice of 1/2 lemon
Directions
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Rub the garlic firmly on both sides of each slice of toasted bread then break the bread apart into large, rough croutons to make about 25 croutons total.  Lay the croutons on a small baking sheet, drizzle with 1 tbsp evoo and toss.  Toast the croutons in the oven about 5 minutes, until golden brown but still slightly chewy in the middle.  Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl toss the mushrooms and the shallots with 3 tbsp evoo, s&p.  Spread mushrooms out in a single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet.  Avoid overcrowding the baking sheet - it might be necessary to use two rimmed baking sheets to roast the mushrooms.  Roast until mushrooms are tender and edges are golden brown, about 10-12 minutes.  While the mushrooms are roasting, toss together the frisee, parsley, chives, sherry vinegar, remaining tbsp evoo and lemon juice.  Season to taste with s&p.  Toss roasted mushrooms and croutons with the frisee mixture.
Serve.
