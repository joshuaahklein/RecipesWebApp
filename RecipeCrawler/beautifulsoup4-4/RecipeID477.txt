Ingredients
2 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
4 large eggs, beaten
1 cup heavy cream
½ lb cooked, lean bacon, crumbled
2 tbsp minced flat-leaf parsley
2 tbsp thinly sliced scallions
1 tbsp roasted garlic puree
Coarse salt/freshly ground black pepper
6 cups ½ inch fresh white bread crumbs
1 cup Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly coat the interior of each of six 4-oz ramekins with the softened butter. Set aside. Whisk the eggs, milk and beer together in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the bacon, parsley, scallions, and garlic puree. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Add the bread cubes and fold them into the liquid. Allow the bread to soak up the egg mixture.
When the bread mixture is very moist, spoon an equal portion of it into each of the prepared ramekins. Place the filled ramekins into a roasting pan and pour in warm water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Place the entire pan in the preheated oven and bake for 45 minutes, or until the edges of the filled ramekins are beginning to brown and the center is almost set. Raise the oven temperature to 400 degrees, and bake the puddings for an additional 10 minutes. (These can be baked early in the day and reheated in a microwave oven, or for 15 minutes in a 325-degree oven just before using) Remove from the oven and serve immediately.
