Ingredients
1 lb ground beef
1 10 oz can enchilada sauce
4 oz velveeta light, cubed
1 package taco seasoning mix, prepared as directed
6 flour tortillas (the 6&quot; size)
1 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
shredded lettuce for garnish
Directions
Preheat oven to 375. In 8x8 or 9x9 baking dish, put 1/2 can of enchilada sauce.  Fry ground beef; drain and return to pan. Add the taco seasoning mix, 1/2 can of diced tomatoes and Velveeta; cook until almost all of the liquid is absorbed. Turn off the heat.  Using 1/3 cup measure, put filling into each of the tortillas and insert in pan (seam-side down). I normally put them in 5 wide and the sixth one in the space remaining at the top. Top with remaining sauce and tomatoes, then add the shredded cheddar on top.  Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes (or until cheese is bubbly). Let stand a few minutes before serving. Don't forget to garnish the enchiladas with lettuce once you serve them!
