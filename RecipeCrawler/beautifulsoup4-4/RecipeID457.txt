A fall-of-the-bone tender turkey that also makes great vegetables and stock for gravy.
Ingredients
Turkey breast (6-9 lbs.)
Turkey or chicken stock
Olive Oil
Potatoes
Carrots
Celery
Onions
Garlic
Poultry seasoning
Parsley
Salt
Crushed black pepper
Directions
24-hours in advance take thawed turkey and rub a small amount of olive oil over turkey - inside and out.  Next rub salt, pepper, parsley, and poultry seasoning on the inside and out of the turkey.  Place back in refrigerator.
Cut carrots, celery, potatoes, and onion into large pieces.  Place a layer on the bottom of the crock pot.  Pour a small amount of stock on the bottom on the crock pot, enough to cover the bottom to steam the turkey.  Season vegetables with additional seasonings.  Place more vegetables in the cavity of the turkey.  Place turkey in the crock pot and add additional seasoned vegetables around the turkey.
Start cooking the turkey.  For at least an hour leave the temperature setting on high, then change the temperature to low.  Cook for around 8 to 10 hours, depending on the size of the turkey.  Provided you don't open the lid many times basting should not be necessary.  Turkey should be at least 165-degrees internally before consumption.
Remove turkey from crock pot and cut to serve.  Vegetables can be eaten or discarded.  Stock and turkey broth combination can be used for gravy.
