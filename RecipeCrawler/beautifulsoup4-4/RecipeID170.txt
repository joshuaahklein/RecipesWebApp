The homemade meat sauce takes hours - but you can certainly tell the difference.
Ingredients
1 lb. ground beef
1 lb. Italian sausage
1 package (14.5 oz.) multi grain spaghetti
4 cans (48 oz.) tomato paste (12 oz. cans)
1 package (8 oz. or 2 cups) shredded Mozzarella cheese
1 Tsp. Italian seasoning
1/4 cup minced garlic
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
salt and pepper to taste
Directions
Brown beef and sausage together in a large pan.  While browning try to break meat into smallest pieces possible.  When brown, drain as much grease as possible.
Once meat is brown and grease is drained add tomato paste and 4 cans of water.  Mix together.  Once well mixed add 1/4 cup minced garlic, 1/4 cup finely chopped onion, 1 Tsp. Italian seasoning, salt and pepper to taste, and mix together well.
Once well mixed reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Cook spaghetti according to directions on package before serving.  Dish up spaghetti on plate and cover with sauce.  Sprinkle with  cheese.  Also great with bread sticks.
