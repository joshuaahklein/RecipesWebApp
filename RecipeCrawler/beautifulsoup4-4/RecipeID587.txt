Ingredients
1 13.6 oz canister of pizza dough
4 oz pepperoni (or a little more if you wish)
1 cup shredded mozzarella (or a little more if you wish)
1/2 cup shredded parmesan
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 jar marinara sauce for serving
Directions
Preheat oven to 400.  Brush a baking sheet lightly with oil; set aside. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into a 12x10 inch rectangle, about 1/4&quot; thick. I normally do not use a rolling pin because out of the canister it is about this size.  Place the pepperoni over the dough leaving a 1&quot; border around the edges. Top with both cheese.  Brush the edge of the dough with the beaten egg. Starting from the long side, roll the dough into a long cylinder, pressing the edges to seal. Transfer the stromboli to the prepared baking sheet, seam side down. Cover the stromboli lightly with nonstick aluminum foil to make a tent and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until golden, approximately 15-25 more minutes.  Let cool 5 minutes before slicing into 2-inch pieces. Serve with marinara.
