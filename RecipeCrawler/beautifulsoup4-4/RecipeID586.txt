Ingredients
1 1/2 lbs boneless beef sirloin steak, cut 1 inch thick
3 Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 3/4&quot; pieces
2 cups loose-pack frozen cut green beans
1 small onion, sliced and separated into rings
1 1/2 cups thick and chunky salsa
1 14oz can low sodium beef broth
1 teaspoon dried basil
2 cloves garlic, minced
Directions
In a crockpot, mix together salsa, broth, basil and garlic. Trim the fat from meat, cut into 1-inch bite-size pieces and toss in the crockpot. Add in potatoes, green beans and onion.  Mix together to ensure that everything has been coated with the sauce mixture. Mine looked like there wasn't enough juice in there but as things cook, more juices will come out so don't worry!  Put the lid on the crockpot and place on low-heat for 8-10 hours or high-high for 4-5 hours. Stir every now and then if you are home. You'll know it is done when the potatoes and beef are easily speared with a fork. If you are within an hour of it being done and it still doesn't look like enough juice is there, add in some more veggies or beef broth.
