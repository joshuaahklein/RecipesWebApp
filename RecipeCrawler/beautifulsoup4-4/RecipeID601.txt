Ingredients
3-4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1/4 cup honey
2 Tbsp. orange juice
1 tsp. orange zest
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 tsp. salt
1/8-1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
1 Tbsp. butter
1/2 tsp. vegetable oil
Parsley or scallions, optional
Directions
In a small bowl, combine honey with orange juice, orange zest, garlic, salt, and red pepper flakes.  Rinse chicken with cold water and pat dry.  Season lightly with salt.
In a large non-stick skillet heat butter and oil over medium-high heat.  Brown chicken on both sides.  Cool, covered, about 10 minutes until almost cooked through.  Pour honey mixture over chicken and cook, turning chicken to coat as sauce begins to thicken, about five minutes.  Serve chicken breasts with honey-orange glaze spooned over the top.
