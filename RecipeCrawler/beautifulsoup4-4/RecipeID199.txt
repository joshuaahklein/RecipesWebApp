1 *8 oz.) pkg. Light Cream Cheese ( I like the texture better, regular is fine)
1 can 14 oz. Progresso Artichoke Hearts, drained, coarsely chopped
1/2 C. Spinach frozen chopped, or steamed
1/4 C. Mayonnaise (do not use Miracle Whip)

1 clove garlic, finely minced
1/2 tsp. Basil (dry 1 Tbsp. Basil Fresh)

Salt and Pepper to taste
Directions
Allow cream cheese to come to room temperature. Cream together mayonnaise, Parmesan, Romano cheese, garlic, basil, and garlic salt. Mix well. Add the artichoke hearts and spinach (careful to drain this well), and mix until blended. Store in a container until you are ready to use. Spray pie pan with Pam, pour in dip, and top with cheese. Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes or until the top is browned. Serve with toasted bread.
