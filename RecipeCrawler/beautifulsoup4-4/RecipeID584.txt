Ingredients
1 pkg white cake mix
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 cup sour cream
3 eggs
1/4 cup water
1 can 21 oz cherry pie filling
1/2 cup toasted sliced almonds
1 cup powdered sugar
1 1/2 tablespoon milk
Directions
Heat oven to 350. Grease and flour a 13x9&quot; baking pan. Beat cake mix, cinnamon, sour cream, eggs, and water until well blended. Pour into the pan and top with spoonfuls of pie filling. Use your finger to push the cherries down into the cake mixture so that the top of the cherry is flush with the rest of the cake. Bake 35 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool the pan on a wire rack and sprinkle half the nuts on top.  Let the cake cool for about 10-15 minutes.
In a small bowl preferably with a spout, whisk together the powdered sugar and milk. If the glaze is too thick, add a little milk. If it's too thin, add more powdered sugar.  Drizzle the mixture over the cake. Add remaining nuts.
