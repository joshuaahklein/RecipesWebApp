Ingredients
1 pound uncooked spaghetti
12 bacon slices, chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 cup 2% reduced fat milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 large eggs
1 cup frozen green peas, thawed
1 ½ cup grated fresh Parmesan cheese
Directions
Cook pasta according to package direction. Drain in a colander over the bowl, reserving about ¾ of the cooking liquid.
While pasta cooks, cook bacon in a large nonstick skillet, until crisp. Remove bacon pieces from the pan, discard fat, reserving 1 tablespoon. Add garlic, and cook for 30 seconds.
In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, salt and black pepper. Add reserved hot cooking liquid, stirring constantly.
Add pasta, milk and egg mixture, and peas to a pan with garlic.
Cook over low heat, for 3 minutes, or until sauce thickens. Add bacon and Parmesan cheese, and toss to combine.
